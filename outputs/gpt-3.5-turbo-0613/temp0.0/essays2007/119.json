No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am so down in the dumps right now because I have just broken off  a two year relationship. I seriously  hope I didn't just throw away the best relationship I ever had or will have. I can't help but feel slightly unattractive right now because PROPNAME has already started to get over me quite well and PROPNAME and PROPNAME don't treat me the way they used to. I don\u2019t understand why people can't simply be honest about the way they feel. I probably have spent half of my life wondering what everyone else was thinking. I t is such a waste of time. If I saw a girl and she seemed really nice, I don't see why I couldn\u2019t just go up to her and be like, \"hi\"  And  guys won't ever meet a girl with the intention of gaining a friend. The whole process is so much more exasperating than it seems worth at times. The friends I have now are my good friends. I just instantly clicked with them. There wasn't any of this trying not to seem overly eager to hang out with you bullshit that usually goes along with the turf of making new  friends. That's sort of why I resent LOCNAME I guess. The stupid system and expectations they have totally just messed me up in the head. I don't have nay self-confidence. It is hard to feel like you are somebody in a class of 0000. I wasn't good at any sports, or at least not good enough to play there. so why did I come to a school with 00000 people full of clicks just like it was in high school?  I will probably be perpetually putting on the front of self-confidence and self-assuredness. that\u2019s what sucks about the world. Everybody just bullshits everyone else. People are so insincere and self-serving. I know I am. there are so many rules that govern the group that you belong to. You can't wear what you want or anything. I am not saying that I don't like the way that I look but every now and then it would be cool to go out in what I want to wear  or whatever and I could know that people weren't  talking about  it behind my back. Looking at my thoughts on screen makes me so ashamed of them. I'm nit a bad person. I just kive up to every part of the whole Greek system that ever gave it a bad name. rush is such a load of crap. everyone acts like they know or care who you are. it all turns out to be the same people in the same crowds that they ran around with in high school. I wish the rest of the work wasn't like this too. But I guess is doesn\u2019t matter where you go because it will always be the same old bullshit. pretty girls date the cutest boys who have the good luck to bring home the big bucks to raise their kids in an upper middle class lifestyle. so it goes. Kurt vonnegut really knew what was up. That's why I like him because he doesn't preach all this \"the sun will come up tomorrow crap\"  he knows that if the sun comes up tomorrow you will probably get a really bad sunburn and die of skin cancer in the end. I hope mark doesn\u2019t meet any girls at this party I just don't want it to be too late to have him back once I get this whole lifestyle change thing out of my system. \nAsnwer:"
