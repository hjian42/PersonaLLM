I know that I have a certain time limit to get a job and I'm trying to get a job but itORGNAME so hard. It's even harder when you've never had a job experience before. And my older sister keeps pestering me about getting a job. I know what I need to do, she just needs to lay off of me sometimes. That's one of the bad things about sharing a dorm room with a sister, she'll be able to spy on you and tell on our parents what's going on in my life. It's not always bad because I don't do anything that will disappoint my parents. The other thing that makes me a little mad is just because she is older than me, she can boss me around. It's not like I'm her slave or anything; it's just that I don't like the feeling of being told what to do and when to do it. I like being my own person, making my own decisions. If only I had been able to do that since I was a kid so I wouldn't have so much problems now. Ever since I could remember, my parents have always wanted me to become a doctor. Any doctor is ok as long as I made it. Well, what they want has followed me into my college life. The only reason why I would want to become a doctor is because my parents insist on me being one. So now I don't really know what I want to major in. I had never been given the chance to really consider my career because it has always been what my parents want. I'm just so obedient. I don't know why but I'm just like PROPNAME in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Always obeying what others says. So, my college life has been ok so far. I like the campus a lot and I also like Jester because it's in the center of everything that I need. The PCL is across the street, and the gym is adjacent to it also. The food is right down on the 0nd floor of Jester or downstairs at ORGNAME. Very convenient. The only bad thing about it so far is that I have a TV and that means trouble. I have become addicted to the show ORGNAME's ORGNAME. I have to watch it everyday. Let's see. It comes on ch. 00 at 00-00pm, ch. 00 at 00-00:00am, ch. 00 at 0-0am. So I stay up late just to watch my Three's Company. I know it's very silly especially since on Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's I have a 0am class. But somehow I manage to get up and not feel tired at all. Amazing isn't it?  But it probably will wear off soon. Another thing I have to mention, I am getting very tired of eating American food for every meal, I need something from my culture. I need my rice!  So, I had a very wonderful Labor Day Weekend because I went to LOCNAME to visit my new baby cousin, PROPNAME. He's 0 weeks old and o so adorable!!  And PROPNAME's almost 0 year old brother is also cute. Whenever we say anything to him all he says is 'I know' or 'I don't know' and laugh. Just so adorable. And when I had to leave, he was all sad. When I picked up my bag, he took it from me and put it back on the floor so I won't leave. I could talk forever about PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But I didn't really like the LOCNAME whether because it was raining the whole time so when we drove anywhere bugs would hit the window and front bumper. So by the end of the trip, the front of the car was smothered with bug guts. YUCK!  hehe =)  Oh no!  My time is almost up!  Well, I guess I can spend the remaining time saying my good byes. Goodbye, chao. Write to you laters. Got only a few more seconds. It has been good writing down my feelings, getting it all out of my system. I feel lighter. OK, BYE!!!!!!!  \nAsnwer:"
