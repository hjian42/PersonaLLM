What I smell, taste, feel like??? Well I'm chewing gum. I've been chewing it fPROPNAME over like 0 hours now. I hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. My gum got hard a long time ago. But somehow the flavor is still intact. It's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 0 minutes. However, I've noticed that PROPNAME's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. There are many pictures on my wall. I stuck all these pics up like 0 days ago. There are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. I don't have one of my family up there. I kind of feel bad in a way. But I don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. I have a picture of them in my drawer if I ever need to see them. But I think it's better with them in my drawer. Every time I look up at these pictures of all my friends, I miss them like no other. Man, I had so much fun last year, in high school in general. But last year was definitely the best year. Man, me, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME in government and Spanish. Those were some good times. I kind of even miss my teachers. And our elephants and doing SCN all the time. We have so many inside jokes. And although I'm sure I'll see PROPNAME again, I'm afraid that when I meet her things won't be the same. And for some reason I'm scared of that. I hope I can go to ORGNAME in the spring. Or actually, I hope PROPNAME can come to LOCNAME for Thanksgiving. Or both would be the best. And we can't forget about going to LOCNAME next summer. I'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But now with this whole separation thing, I know that our traveling days with the PROPNAME family are over. Those were some fun trips too. I feel so blessed to have a friend like PROPNAME. And even PROPNAME and stuff. People that I've known my whole life. That even know I don't see them too often, when I do, you can tell that there's something there. Like I feel so close to them cause I practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. It's a really nice feeling. I'm also blessed for PROPNAME and the whole family. God, PROPNAME and PROPNAME really do care about me and PROPNAME like we were their own kids. And just knowing that really means a lot to me. And I hope that mom feels the same way about PROPNAME cause that would only be fair. So we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and I'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. But I love the Professor; we call him Dr. EO. Hahaha, he's really cool. Like I walk into his class and he's like \"do you want a drink?\" Wow, I was like thinking \"what is this?\" Oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. The office kind of reminds me of the The Vinci Code. I don't know why, maybe the whole \"Louvre\" idea. I always say I hate LOCNAME and stuff but I really don't. I just think it's kind of funny to say that. But I really don't know why it's funny. But I mean I've said it so many times now that I really think I've instilled the idea into my head. Like I really don't want to travel to LOCNAME in the summer. But I mean if PROPNAME wants to, then I really don't care. I think I'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. Like about my grades- I mean if I don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? I mean, I'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. But I mean if for whatever reason I don't, then I think I'll be ok. I mean, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. Plus, if I have my own family then I don't think I'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. Man, it's a complicated issue. We got a phone in our room, the same one I had in my room at home. But I haven't used it once here. If anything, PROPNAME has used it way more than me. Man, I haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause I don't want them calling in case they call when I'm not here and then have to talk to PROPNAME. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of, them talking to PROPNAME or PROPNAME talking to them. No, but PROPNAME's really cool. But so is PROPNAME's roommate. Man, I wish I had a roommate like her. Dude, me and PROPNAME need to start hanging out more often. But I never want us to have the same friends. PROPNAME is one of PROPNAME's friends. Majoring in Japanese and stuff. Wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. I've always wanted to take some random language like Japanese. I don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. Like me learning a African language and spe \nAsnwer:"
