I never remember the dORGNPROPNAMEMEe anymore since I quit my job this summer. I think it is the 0nd now that I think about it. Anyway, I guess I will be writing until about 0:00. that gives me a little time left over until I have to go to Psy 000 today. I wonder what the movie will be about. I really hate sitting in class for an hour and a half strait. What really stinks is that all my classes are like that. Except my Calculus discussion class. It is only 00 minutes long a day, two days a week. I just got out ORGNAME that class. My TA in there is really boring. He reminds me of a Seinfeld episode. The one with the low-talker. I don't really watch Seinfeld, but I saw that one. He is extremely dry too. He stands in front of the board when he writes, and that makes it extremely hard to see what he is doing. Sometimes he even erases stuff before the class even gets to see it at all. Some teachers just really stink like that. Other than that 000 minutes a week, my classes are going pretty good.      I have been writing for 0 minutes now. Whoever is reading this (if anyone is at all) will have to trust me. I am not an ultra fast typer, so the form might not be as long as some students, but I guess it isn't the size that counts. :-)      I am at a loss for words now. My roommate would love this assignment. He can talk forever. I have know PROPNAME (my roommate) for nearly 0 years now. It is weird that we are still friends. He is so moody all the time, I never know how to act around him. He is great and all, but it is like living with a women who is constantly having her period. Serious mood swings. He is gay, so I guess it is kind of like living with a women. I'm not gay though. Here is a question. You decide whether or not this is fair. the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME thinks nothing about letting two homosexual partners (male or female) live in the same room with one another all year. LOCNAME doesn't have one problem with that. However, they get all pissy when my girlfriend is in my dorm room after 00:00 on weekdays, and 0:00 on weekends. Tell me the logic of that. Please. Someone tell me the difference between me and PROPNAME having sex all night long (not going to happen though) and PROPNAME and I having sex all night long. Not even sex. Just sleeping in the same bed. Tell you what, not even sleeping, but just talking with one another. I am not a sexaholic yet anyway. Does that seem to bother anyone else but me?        I guess I found a few words. It is 0:00.      PROPNAME and I have been dating for nearly 0 years now. I have only had one other girlfriend in my life. We started dating in Junior High school. Man!  It hasn't even seemed like that long. We were engaged for a short period of time last year, but since then we have decided to back up to \"dating\" again. It was her decision really. I wanted to get married this Christmas break, but she had a change of heart. We are still going to get married, just a little farther down the road.    Well, I suppose that that is my 00 minutes of streaming. That flew by rather quickly. This was a good idea on your parts. See you all in class. PROPNAME A PROPNAME PROPNAME \nAsnwer:"
