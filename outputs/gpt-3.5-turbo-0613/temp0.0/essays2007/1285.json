I thought I was going to meet to meet a lot of new people here. I don't know what to do? Why am I here? I don't even know what I want to be. Is college even for me? I hate that song. I think I could be happy with a low paying job. I don't know. People here are different; maybe it's just me. College is supposed to be the best time. I over think everything. I should just go with the flow. Everyone tells me you will love it here once I meet a few people, but it seems unlikely. I have met a lot of new cool people, but I can't see them being as close as my friends back home. Even the girls here act differently. I have meet a lot of new girls, but it wasn't what I expected. It seems like I'm the only one who feels this way. I know I over think everything. Maybe I'm not giving U. T. a chance. I think I'm trying, but I feel awkward here. I worry way too much. I don't know why I always think about this. That music is loud. I hate complaining like this, its useless, but it's all I think about. Who knows maybe I'll meet new people when I go to I. S. A. tonight. But I know it's going to be like everything else, you might meet new people but you will never see them again or get to know them. I'm so glad I am going home this weekend. What will I do? \nAsnwer:"
