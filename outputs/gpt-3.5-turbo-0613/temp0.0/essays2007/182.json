I'm going to use periods and capitalize out of habit O. K. I had a dream two nights ago and I was at some LOCNAME awards ceremony. This lady introduced me to kirstie PROPNAME as I was sitting at a table. I looked over, and it was not PROPNAME PROPNAME but PROPNAME PROPNAME, some other actress. Anyway, it was weird. Then on the very next night after that dream, I was watching a movie on PROPNAME PROPNAME and she was in it. I rarely see her on T. V. and I was astonished. It is very relevant, because I am reading a book right now called the Celestine Prophecy. This book is very cool. It talks about some ancient manuscript found in LOCNAME that is going to change every human beings consciousness. It is very involved, but the first insight in this manuscript says that at the end of the 00th century people are going to become more and more aware of these coincidences. It is amazing because I have been having many of these lately such as that dream. Also, on the way over here  I turned on my car, and I thought of this song by Jewel. I turned the station and that song was on the radio. Unbelievable, right?  I don't think so, man,/. this kind of thing happens to me all the time. Ok I finished a focus question for history class before I came here and I also watched Seinfeld. It was the one where PROPNAME picks up a deaf lineswoman at a tennis match. PROPNAME makes a mess of himself with an ice-cream sundae and they get it on T. V. PROPNAME\u2019s girlfriend breaks up with him and he doesn't know why then PROPNAME tells PROPNAME alright I'm not gonna sit here and talk about Seinfeld for 00 minutes. I am so happy like not really just kidding alright wrong here we go alright You are all just a bunch of hacks. Lets get ready to rumble in the LOCNAME Joy boy girl swirl pearl grapes of wrath. ORGNAME's theory on Dionysus man Let's call ourselves the Doors man. Like the doors in your mind, acid. LOCNAME LOCNAME. When the doors of perception are cleansed, we will see things as they truly are, immaculate. That was a line from Oliver stones, The Doors good flick. It is total irony how PROPNAME PROPNAME has a poem where he says, Did you have a good life when you died, Enough to base the movie on. He must have known they would make a movie about him. Strange days. I'm taking PROPNAME PROPNAME classes. That should be very beneficial to me. I must do well in school this semester. Man that is a big deal to me Wow I'm really looking forward to the ORGNAME football game. It should be a good one. I really want a piece of glass you  know. My grandmother died last week on the same night Princess PROPNAME  died. Was that some kind of luck, or what. I want to die at a reasonable age. Death, now there's something I could talk about Nope let's see Mi hermano no va a LOCNAME para la funeral. Neither am I. Is that wrong, I don't think so. Man let's just increase the peace I can't believe I just said that There is a reason to live. We are all one consciousness functioning at different levels on the same paralysis of unending consequences of our reaction to the global warming issue in LOCNAME LOCNAME for the love of LOCNAME. They are going to read my thing and go nuts man. Who am I talking to. Sometimes when I'm sitting alone I think as if someone were with me. This is a good thing, for the love of my family is always going to be there. \nAsnwer:"
