    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Everything we experience is filtered through our mind, and if that mind is contaminated by thoughts, preconceived notions, or the need to continuously categorize everything our experiences become tainted. Later when we realize the error, the experience seems somewhat lost because what it was abased on is no longer true. Thinking about past experiences blinds you to the present especially when trying to compare the two. The past cannot be altered by the realization of a mistake, but it can't be relived at the same time. To move along, trusting nothing and everything, simultaneously and exclusively, through each experience, is to forgo all attachment, all security, all dependence, all crutches. The things that you continue, to do out of routine, out of habit is not something done for love. Love can exist without any sort of routine if all attachment is dissolved. Evolution involves change, change can catch you offguard but it is inevitable. To be strong is to change, to adapt to each situation and expect nothing. Unmet expectations, grasping to the future, grasping to the past &#0000;all are causes of suffering, anxiety, and tension. To evolve is to transcend the suffering anxiety and tension and necessitates eliminating the causes of pain that reside in your own mind. People can inflict pain and suffering only if you let them, if your mind is contaminated by constructs. Objectifying experience removes the suffering but also removes the joy. To cleanse your mind is not the same as objectifying everything around you. To evolve is to transcend the suffering and still experience. Everything everywhere is constantly changing so if you hold on to it, its going to drag you around, but if you let go the current will carry you. PROPNAME PROPNAME looks really busy but we have no coffee so to flow with the current is to move through the lane of least resistance which only you know because the current is in your mind, it is your mind. The line between love and attachment is often confused and blurred because there is no line. You draw the line and you choose where to stand, but you can't be afraid to run around cross the line erase the line but you must choose. Even walking the line is a choice, you cannot deny that. \nAsnwer:"
