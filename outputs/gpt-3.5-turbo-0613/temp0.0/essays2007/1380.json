I don't have a computer yet PC Mall told me that the one that I wanted would be at least a month because it's backordered. My friend is singing bad German grammar phrases. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and I just ordered a pizza, and now we're worried that we will get fat. She's still dancing like a complete moron she thinks that she is a hummingbird. I think that I will party hard on Saturday night but not as hard as on last Friday. I got really inebriated and bruised myself in several nondiscreet places. PROPNAME is trying to dictate what I should be writing, but this is my assignment, not hers. PROPNAME smokes crack, and PROPNAME likes to hum really bad show tunes. PROPNAME, please turn the light back on. PROPNAME just came in wearing an American Outpost shirt. I think that this computer does not like me very much. This Cure song is so wonderful. I'm going to ORGNAME ORGNAME's on Tuesday so that I can shake my groove thing to some quaint 00s tunes. Simple Minds, PROPNAME PROPNAME, ORGNAME, LOCNAME, ORGNAME ORGNAME, The GoGos, TheB00sthey're all wonderful! I think that I need to go shopping for some new clothes sometime soon. I should have brought my music down here. Would I wear a black lace skirt with nothing underneath? Probably not, but I wouldn't put it past myself. PROPNAME loves to hump monkeys, and PROPNAME likes to screw donkeys. The pizza man better hurry the hell up I'm starving! This room is really freaking cold (chilly is not cool). The music just got louder, but it's not any better. I don't think that I would look very good in a charcoal gray skirt. Red is definitely my color. My radishes were growing mold, so I threw them out. Old ORGNAME is for high schoolers, Gap is for college kids, and LOCNAME LOCNAME is for the working world. How much longer do I need to type on this damn computer? I would rather write by hand any day. I think my eyes are glazing over from the absurd brightness of the screen. Oohback cramps! My vixen red nail polish is chipping time to redo. random thoughts are running through my head. rings on my fingers but no bells on my toes PROPNAME has a rash on her leg. Big bruise on my thigh. Now I'm just making stuff up. Are my 00 minutes up yet? Guess not. When I start typing randomly, I don't make any sense. Ladybugs everywhere. Ska is fun. Come on PROPNAME. I'm out of things to talk about now it's all going downhill. \nAsnwer:"
