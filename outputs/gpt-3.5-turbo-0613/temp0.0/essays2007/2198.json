No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing,\" but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME is going well. I got paid $00 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to \"diet\" for the next week, though they stress that it's not \"diet[ing],\" but more \"finding a homeostasis\" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a ORGNAME box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true. And, because I'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, I'll delve a little bit into my personal life. I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to ORGNAME for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because ORGNAME is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 0th of may, they don't get out till the 00th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked PROPNAME, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate PROPNAME and I might go visit them up in LOCNAME during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the PROPNAME PROPNAME soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at ORGNAME with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss PROPNAME, and PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie \"The Good Girl\" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have. \nAsnwer:"
