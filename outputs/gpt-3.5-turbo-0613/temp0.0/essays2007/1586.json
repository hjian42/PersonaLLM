No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      Well, this is definetly the first assignment of its kind that I have ever done, I can only hope that i can find enough things to think about for 00 minutes, wait 00 minutes and 00 seconds. That was some math I was hoping to avoid. I wish it wasn't so early, as a matter of fact I shouldnt be awake right now, my next class doesnt start for two hours, nap time, YES! oh wait no thats not right There is still that whole writing thing I'm doing. Come to think about it this is a fairly effective way of making sure that all the students put the same amount of time, and at least a comparable amount of effort in there assignment. For better or for worse. At least the week has begun. In high school thats the last thing I would be thinking early on a monday morning, but it's how I feel now. Upon self reflection though I realize it's not just my insatiable lust for learning that drives me on in the week but rather a combination of that and the fact that I had to work all weekend. Oh well the week will be like a little vacation for me. Looking around the room I see some posters, some course sylabi, some empty cups, textbooks, oh yeah posters. The last one that I got from those irish vendors downstairs, where in LOCNAME did they say they were from? Can't Remember. Anyway the poster was one I had somehow missed the first time around, hard to imagine since its so darn cool. It's a nice photograph of an H bomb, its really the peice of art that allows the Zen of my tiny dorm room to be complete. right. Ok almost half way there. almost. almost. yes. Good. Even though this is a course assignment I feel very idle, a feeling that I don't particularly like. don't get me wrong I like not having anything to do but I have stuff to do, and was actually set to do it this fine morning. I wonder if the tracing of consciousness would be interrupted by catching up in the reading in my philosophy (abortion, everyones favourite topic). Well of course it wouldn't, but I am sure my ability to trace it would be impaired, and we wouldnt want that to happen. The abortion chapter in philosophy has really gotten me thinking (also thinking I need to finish that first chapter). It was something that I had never given much thought to other then what I saw or read in the media, or touched on in political discussions. I had always considered myself largely pro-choice, but being confronted with logical philosophical arguements has led me to rethink my stance and now I have absolutely no idea what to think about the issue. Of course there are an untold number examples of things that are philosophically logical, but practically not practical (I wonder of unpractical is a real word, yeah it must be, damn). Was there something about us not going back and changing what we wrote the first time? If there wasnt there should be. Except maybe with they dozens of typos I am constantly correcting. three seconds left bye. Continue writing? I don't think so. \nAsnwer:"
