I don't care if a lot is supposed to be 0 separate words. I like this song. wow It's already been 0 minute. I guess I just think slowly. hmmm, my mind just went blank. oh crap, I have 0 classes tomorrow. did I finish all my homework yet?  oh shit, I have a lot of calculus to catch up on. I've only done like 0 assignment out of 0!  PROPNAME is talking to PROPNAME and it's interrupting my stream of consciousness. hey. if you're unconscious, and you have a dream, is that stream of Unconsciousness??  hahaahahaha  that's a cool thought!!   ahhahahha!! oh cool, my friend is online!  she was at the party on Saturday that I dj'ed. I thought I dj'ed crappy ORGNAME everyone says I ORGNAME like a club DJ. I wish I could DJ ORGNAME but ORGNAME is owned by DJ boombai. I wonder if he's any good. he uses records instead of CD's. I hear he spins hip hop. I guess I have a chance since I mix club music and not hip hop. PROPNAME is instant messaging me!  argh, I've written so much and it's only been 0 minutes. do I really have to do this for 00 minutes?  this is pretty brainless. I wish all writing assignments were like this. wow it's late already. I go to sleep too late everyday. I better go to sleep early. all we do is watch TV. marc mcgwire broke the homerun record today. that's pretty cool. I wonder how PROPNAME sosa feels. I bet he's happy for him but deep inside he was like \"damn, I almost had it!\"  he still has a chance though. wow my bed is messy. the covers are like everywhere. I like my posters. chow yun-fat's gun is cool looking. Acura integra is such a cool car, especially the type R. I wish I had a type R. after college, I want to get a type R. I wonder if I'll be rich after college. I hope I'm rich. I wonder what my future will be like. I wonder if I'll be living in an apartment or a house. I wonder when I'll get married. I want to get married around 00 - 00. I wonder who I'll marry. I wonder if it'll be my girlfriend right now. I really like her a lot. I can't imagine being without her. she was at the party on Saturday too. I wonder if anyone else will get me to DJ their parties. I hope so - I want to make some extra money. what the hell kind of song is this?  mp0's are the coolest things!  I can download them for free and burn them onto a CD and make my own favorite CD's. I might go for a masters degree. I might get more money. I know!  when I get my bachelors, I'll look for a high paying job. then if I don't get a good job, I'll go back for the masters. I can imagine myself as a traveling type of businessman, getting up early in the morning, taking a shower, putting on my armani suit, kissing my wife goodbye, driving my PROPNAME to work, coming back in rush hour traffic, and doing it all over again. ooh how long has it been?  it's been 00 minutes. cool!  I'm almost done with this one. I wonder how long the next assignment is. I still have to do that pretesting thing. PROPNAME and PROPNAME have been gone for a long time. I wonder when they'll be back. I wonder what they're doing. did they work out or hoop?  my girlfriend is a private investigator. hahhahhahaa  lethal weapon 0 was a cool movie. jet li is awesome. he kicks ass. I wonder if I'll have time to take martial arts next year. should I take capoeira or kung fu with my because?  I hate this song. john's taking a shower. something is beeping. my contacts are dry. I want to play starcraft. that's a fun game. I like to build up and overwhelm the opponent. oop, times up. \nAsnwer:"
