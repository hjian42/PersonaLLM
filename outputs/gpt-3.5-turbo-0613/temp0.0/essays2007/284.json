No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well I really do have alot I should be doing right now but I thought I would get this out of the way and I want to do it early because I am paranoid it won't get sent by some freak accident. Anyway I really need to get stuff done. I need tp study for French even though it's a French I test and I've been in French for 0 years so hopefully I will do o. k. Some guy just tried to chat with me but I told him I was busy and now I feel kinda bad. Oh well he'll get over it. People in LOCNAME really do try to chat with other people in LOCNAME alot. The only people that try to talk to me are online. Maybe it's because I intimidate people. I'm 0 feet tall. I like it though because most guys find it really attractive. My boyfriend loves it. He lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME so it really doesn't matter anyway. I really love him. I met him LOCNAME In May after graduation and he has called me just about every night since. He's even coming down here next month to see me. I really miss him. He really can't even afford to come down because he works in a casino in LOCNAME LOCNAME. That actually kinda bothers me. He's 00 years old. He really needs some ambition. That's something I really admire in people. I've got alot myself. I hope to be a producer someday and live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm already ready to graduate. I miss my friends from home. Hopefully I can see PROPNAME in 0 weeks. I may go to visit my brother at ORGNAME so hopefully we can hang out. I really feel like people don't understand me. I really wish PROPNAME lived closer. I know he loves me. I went with my roommate to visit her boyfriend at LOCNAME this weekend. It was fun. I just really miss my boyfriend even more now. I really nee to read for ORGNAME right now. I want to read ahead for this week. I just want to get out of here. I just wish I could pack up my bags and move to LOCNAME. I do want an education so I guess I'll stick around here for four years or so. I need to call PROPNAME. I ran into my old boyfriend the other day but I pretended I didn't see him. He is someone I will never get over. He had the most amazing mind. He is going to be very successful one day. I feel like he is out of my league. I know I'm not but he just never really understood me. I hope I see him again this week and maybe I will have the courage to talk to him. \nAsnwer:"
