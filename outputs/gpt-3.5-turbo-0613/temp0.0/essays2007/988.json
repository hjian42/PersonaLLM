No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: ok I begin writing now without thinking about the writing that I'm doing this is so eird why do this why proffessor make us do this will he be reading what we're writing or not and will he be able to see what I'm thinking by just reading. will it offer insight into what my mind works like is it going to help him see what kind of person that I am I miss jun where is she where was she last night I want to have sex with her I want to have a relationship with hertooo this is weird I'm writing dowwn exactly what I'm thinking and it all comes so fast I'm not even thinking like I normally think usually there' ssome kind of method to the way that I do it but now I'm just writing and I'm not even having complete thoughts leading to ideas and resolutions now I want to shift thinking so that I can do some productive thinking or maybe not waste time but I'm stuck on this and I guess I should do what the assignment says jun makes a sound that's so sexy when I lick her earlobe it makes me want to fuck her wow I wonder if anyone will read that and think I'm some kind of pshycho this is so weird I shouldn't care what I write, but my name's on this so I have to worry but I'm sick of worrying about things that's why I drink so that nothing matters that's why I like smoking pot because no worries that's not why I like to have relationships with girls though that's more psychological and I think thati have these relationships because its something to put my energy into to figure out that I'm not into damn I just stopped accidentally owh well now its time for a new stream I need to do this work so that I can get my good grades so that I can get into good school so I can make good money so I can have happy life so I'll be happy but so often to do this I have to do things that make me unhappy I like this classbut not some of my other classes like english where the teacher's a bitch and where I spend the whole time looking at jun because she's a beautiful girl and I want her why do so many of my thoughts concern sex and lust annd anger and fear and worry it would be easier to eliminate the last three this isn't really stream of consciousness writing because I'm actually being much more random in my thoughts than I usually amn so this assignment doesn't make any sense I wonder if thy use this for any psychoanalytical purpose I wonder if other people's writing is similar to minee in any way I guess so since there are fundamental similarities between all human brains and minds that can't be overcome and I'm not that diffeerent from others in that respect I wish I was more like others but not sacrificing the things that are important to me I wish I had a steady girlfriend that always makes me much happier I just met jun and hooked it up with herand now I don't understand the rlationship and don't know if it'll continue and that's frustrating because I want it to and at the same time don't because she's dkind of a slut and might ahve a disease but I lust for her and she's the only girl who's paid me any attention so I really want to have a relationship with her though I'll prbably get hurt and feel like I should never have done it and then I'll be sad again but for now I'm happy when I'm with her and I feeel good when I'm with her and its good I'm still worried that I think about hers o much and that someone will read this that's why these tests are total crap because I have to spend so much time worrying about what the shrink thinks because I ahve this facade to put up for some reason although it won't affect my grade and it won't affect my relationship because I probably won't ever see him agaian and I won't have to face him but STILL I worry why do I do that what am I so afraido of revealing and why ami so afraid of people really knowing what's inside am I that evil and suppressing that much of myself that its making me put up a false front that I think everyone should see why do I opress ok this is really weird I'm starting to get very introspective this is probably not what I was supposed to todo but oh well now I'll be able to keep typing I forgato my ttrain of thought my typing is becomeing more and more flawed because I'm mjust closing my eyes and letting it all flow out on paper fuck jun I'm letting it go I hte something I love something I'm getting in tough cwith emotions I want women I like them they smell good this is funny to whoever reasds this oh well laugh because I guess it really is maybe I'll read it myself afterwords and have a good giggle at myself and maybe that's the point of life to be comfortable withwho you are and what goes on in your head its almost time to stop althought I was just getting very interested int he results and in to what I was writing times up. \nAsnwer:"
