I am asked to write a short page analysis of this theme, a stream of consciousness. At least I am choosing to analyze this theme and expound upon it. To begin, I first want to break down what a \"stream of consciousness\" literally means. The first word stream could be defined as something(water, words, life) flowing in a forward motion. The word consciousness is the state of being conscious rather than unconscious, which is what you are when you sleep. When we go to class, drive our cars, and talk to friends we are of a conscious mind at least we hope so. Our conscious mind is active. We are aware and responsible for our actions. The opposite of the conscious mind is the unconscious mind. People use their unconscious mind when they are in a deep sleep or are in a coma, also termed as unconscious. A good example of being in an unconscious state of mind and not knowing or meaning your physical actions is sleep walking. While being in an unconscious state of mind people mysteriously jump out of bed, sprint outside, and run into oncoming traffic. The next day they have no recollection of the whole incident. So a stream of consciousness could describe your life when you are awake. We are in a constant, flowing forward stream of consciousness. We cannot reverse the hands of time and swim against the current. Our actions and words while we are awake shape our stream, our stream of consciousness. Our stream is filled with rocks, sharp turns, and one day we will fall off the waterfall at the end of our stream. \nAsnwer:"
