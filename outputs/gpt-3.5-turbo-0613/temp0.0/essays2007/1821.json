I wasn't too scared about it cause I knew that nothing would happen. It was just kind of sad, I guess. Everytime I turned on the T. V. there was something about it. The sad stories, the encouraging ones about the heroes. By the end of the day, I was just kind of fed up with it. There was this one part that certaintly got my attention. On ORGNAME, they were having this 00 seconds thing, where some people talked about something dealing with 0/00. THere was this one guy who had a long beard, and looked liked an Afghan, and he said that one day this guy just punched him out of no where, just because he looked like that. I think that is just so extremely stupid, he wasn't even an Muslim, he was a Shikh or something. I mean you cannot really blame the few that did that to the entire Muslim society. I mean there are 0 billion Muslims, they can't all be terrorists. But I don't really blame them, cause I mean even if I was in their places, I would kind of react the same way. Although, I would try not to. But, now things are changing. Not many people hate you just because one is a Muslim. Oh well, enough about this.   I saw this cute chick on 0/00. She was in the biology class. She was just sooo  cute. I should have talked to her, but before i knew it she was gone. Hopefully, i will see her next time.          Today was the draw for the texas-ou game. I didn't get the tickets, my draw number was on the 00000s, and the tickets were sold out at 00000. This kind of . . I mean only 000 people got to get tickets, i mean, why they couldnt more tickets for the students. I was really disappointed. But i am still a freshmen so maybe next coming years.          I am going home this weekend, first time after school started. I am really looking forward to it. Just need a few days away from ORGNAME. Its seems like I have been here more than 0 weeks. It should be fun.        I also have test coming up starting next week. Hopefully i will do good. I really need to make as many As as i can. I have to transfer to the school of Business, which is the hardest to get into. Hopefully, i will get in.          After i get done with this, i have to finish my Calculus homework. Its due tomm at 0 in the morning. What kind of time is that. Last week i didnt turn it in because i thought, it was 0 in the afternoon. I didnt look if it was p. m. or a. m. I was done with it too. I was sooooooo mad. I guess i learned my lesson though. BUt still, 0 in the morning, whats up with the time.          I had a quiz in Economics today, it was soo hard compared to the one last week. Last week's quiz was a piece of cake. IT was sooo easy. I hate when teacher/sorry professors do this. THey make the first test/quiz easy and the second or the final exam are like really hard. Be consistent, you know.         I have 0 minutes left, ummm,  This class is kind of fun. I like Dr. PROPNAME, if i spelled that right, his examples and stuff are soo funny. But my Economics professor is just as cool, Dr. PROPNAME. Both of the class are fun. Cal and CHemistry are alright, not as much fun.        It is soo quiet in this lab, you could hear the roar of the computers. LOCNAME is weird, sometimes is soo quiet, while other soo crowded and loud. I guess i am getting used to it though. Well my time is up. It was fun writing this. Its kind of girly though, like a journal.     \nAsnwer:"
