College life is fun and all, but I miss the comforts of home. At the dorm, there is always something \"extremely important\" to do at every moment. Someone is always dropping by and visiting or calling on the phone. I have sorority events to go to or a date, or something. I am getting so overwhelmed by it all. I suddenly have so many responsibilities. Like making sure I wake up for class on time, washing my dishes, making sure I eat enough meals, try to fit in studying every once in a while, follow all of my sorority rules at all times. And my current boy situation is so overwhelming. Suddenly, no that I am single, there seem to be an overabundance of guys. They are everywhere and are always giving out their phone numbers. It is so weird to not have a boyfriend since PROPNAME and I were together for 00 months. To make that situation worse, he is still so present in my life. Our break up was just one of the many major changes in my life with the beginning f college. I know that lots of girls feel the need to \"find themselves\" once in college, and it seemed so bizarre to me before I actually was in their shoes. I mean, don't you know who you are? I thought that I did, but now that everything is so different, I feel very lost and confused about who I am and what types of values/morals I have. Up to this point, every decision I made was affected to some degree by my parents. For example, my 0 a. m. curfew had an extreme affect onm where I went at night, how much sleep I got each night. Also, there were rules on who I went out with, because my parents had to meet them beforehand. Now, I can come and go as I please with no questions asked. I'm not so sure that is a good thing. I mean, just because I am 00, that does not mean I suddenly competent to run my entire life. I miss being able to come home everyday and tell my mom all of my daily triumphs and failures. Although, I think that mom and I talk more now than when I lived at home (not that home is far away, only twenty minutes. We talk almost five times a day. But it is different than having here tuck me in each night and hug me when I am down. What is also so diffucult now is that when I need someone to talk to, all of closest friends are thousands of miles away at their own universities. So, I am left with trying to reveal my emotions to practical strangers that I have formed some sort of bond with. Friendships are difficult and delicat things. I know that everyone is looking for a friend right now, especcially me, and yet true friendships don't just form overnight. They take months to form a feeling of trust and compassion between two people. You cannot just jump in and say \"Oh we are best friends now. \" That is why soroity life is so strange now. I have been thrown into this new \"family\" in which we are all supposed to be friends, and yet I don't even know most of their names. I guess that over time, we will get close, but right now, it is akward. However, I am thankful to have somewhere to go when I get lonely. Which is quiet often now that all of friends are gone. \nAsnwer:"
