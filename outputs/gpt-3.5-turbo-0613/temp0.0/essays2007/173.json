It's not like high school where you are playing only to get into college, now, more or less, you are playing for the rest of your life. It seems rather dramatic when you think about it. How can an eighteen year old hold the future in his or her hands. That seems rather demanding. However, the possibility of greatness and success can motivate five- year olds, it seems. Anyway, 00000 people is certainly a lot to contend with. Pressure seems to fill the air everywhere. Not that I mind it at all. I kind of like the atmosphere that engulfs LOCNAME. The attitude of \"wanting to learn \" is beneficial to everyone involved in the higher education process. High School seems like a distant memory now that I'm here. It's extremely hard to imagine that only a few months ago I was a Senior. Man was that fun to say. I enjoyed every second of my senior year, but this year will be so much better. Thinking of the Princess PROPNAME tragedy. . She was a wonderful woman. I think that outside her death, the biggest tragedy to come out of this deal is the fate of her children. I couldn't possibly imagine the stress and trauma of losing my mother. That's seems incomprehensible at my age. I look now to the rest of the school year. It seems so intimidating right now. I don't know how the courses will be and I hope that my work ethic will stand firm. I think that my favorite quote is \"Greatness courts failure\"  I don\u2019t think there is anything more true in this world than that. I first heard it on Tin Cup. What a great flick. I saw PROPNAME in the Hood last night for the first time in years. Outside of the young boy giving the PROPNAME PROPNAME '00 sign the bird, the movie was spectacular. Funny how there were riots in LOCNAME LOCNAME on the night of the movie's premier. That seems odd. The movie is very sympathetic to the myriad of problems in LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME and automatically, there is public outcry. That's like riots in LOCNAME when PROPNAME was released (Didn\u2019t happen, but serves as a sarcastic counter point. The best movie of all time maybe Braveheart, but the best movie of last year was PROPNAME PROPNAME, hands down. Good love story and date flick. I recommend it to anyone who reads my babble here. Furthermore, it is imperative to realize the implications and the modifications of absolutely nothing. I just like typing implications and modifications. Do do do a da da da. Theme of a funny commercial I saw yesterday, one of the many considering how bored I was. Slothfulness can certainly be enjoyable, though \nAsnwer:"
