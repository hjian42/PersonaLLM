No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: my thoughts, feelings, and sensations?  right now?  my eyes feel vacant, my heart feels heavy. at the moment?  now, in my dorm, in the silence of others and the sound only of ani's enlightening lyrics via stereo, I cannot hide behind the facade of a smile. there is no need to. unless I should be concerned with impressing a professor of some sort with a great stream of consiousness piece of writing. this is my consiousness, and I suppose it really isn't so interesting. I am worried, that is one sensation ripping through my veins. I am worried I will fail french, (how can you teach someone a new language in that language?) I don't understand. I am worried about things that cannot be voiced anywhere. I am worried about things you are not supposed to talk about. not to strangers. not to family. not to friends, unless they don't mind the burden. \"god help you if you are an ugly girl, course too pretty is also your doom\" as ani says. I know what she means; I have felt both ways, too often. I will choose the ugly girl, though. she has the better deal. she doesn't have to be afraid. I never fully understood the truth to this until I came here, to austin, to college. I didnt realize what a risk it is to be a \"pretty girl. \"  this is taking a strange turn, sorry, I havent quite figured out how to regulate my stream of consiousness. but this is what I think about. does he think I'm pretty?  god, I hope not. oh, please let someone else get in the elevator with us, don't leave me alone with him. how fast can I run if he approaches me. these are now everyday thoughts for me. I never used to be like this. I am ashamed of the girl I have become in the last week. I have discovered several things about myself since last tuesday. I am not, in any sense, the righteous babe (an ani term) I thought I was. I am a scared little girl. I cannot stand up to those who hurt me; I have proven that this week. in lieu of retaliation and justice, I cower in the shadows, I cling to my boyfriend, I cry myself to sleep. my mind is full of thoughts, so many I can't sort them all. so only the prominant ones come through to the screen. I apologize that they can't be the happy ones, the ones that say how much I love college, life, and my psychology class. I am not worthy of so many things, I think maybe my hypothalamus doesn't secrete enough of that happy stuff. my feelings are not so great at the moment; perhaps I should have chosen to write this some other time. I am so naive and stupid. those are my thoughts. that I allowed this horror to happen to me, to my boyfriend; that I am doing nothing about it. that I am writing about it here for someone I have never spoken to to read it. I miss my little brother. my baby four year old brother. he is my favorite person in the entire world. I am looking at a picture of him now, holding a wooden sword, pretending to be either david crockett or obi wan kenobi. welp, my twenty minutes are up. thank you, doctor. \nAsnwer:"
