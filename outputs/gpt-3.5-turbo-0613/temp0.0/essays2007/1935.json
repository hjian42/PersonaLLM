    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I need to write this paper for psychology to get a good grade in the class. This assignment is much easier than some of the other assignments I have gotten in my other classes. But, then again, my other classes aren't necessarily hard. I mean, in History of Rock Music, I have to go see a concert and report on it. How cool is that?!  I wish I could go to a Coldplay concert. I would love to go to a COldplay concert. I like their music. I like the Beatles too. I'm listening to a Beatles song right now. I believe PROPNAME wrote PROPNAME\". I went to the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert last October. It was totally amazing. I wish I could go again. I saved my ticket stub and put it in a box that I store all the important little trinkets I want to keep. I put all my concert tickets in there. I really need good grades in order to get into the ORGNAME school. I really want to become a film maker. I would love to become the next PROPNAME PROPNAME. Producing seems really cool, but really hard. I would love to direct, but directing seems like one of the most impossible jobs to do successfully. I would love to one day be a well known and respected film maker. I love old films. Last Sunday, the State theater on ORGNAME showed Gone With the Wind. I went to the movie instead of the LOCNAME football game. I don't like football as much as I like old movies. It was so worth it. To see one of my favorite movies of all time on the big screen was amazing. I walked to the theater, and I decided to take the bus back. Only, I was not aware that the busses have different route on game days. I got on the number 0 bus and ended up around LOCNAME LOCNAME. It turned out okay though, because the bus circles the mall and comes back towards campus. I got off the bus on PROPNAME PROPNAME street and had to walk back to my dorm in LOCNAME in the rain. The movie was still worth it. PROPNAME PROPNAME. That's also the name of the main character in the movie: The Usual Suspects. That is a good movie. For the longest time, I hadn't seen it, but then my brother kept telling me that I shouldn't see it because it is excellent. Well, during move-in a couple of weeks ago, when everybody was in a frenzy, I just hung out for a couple of days at my brother's house. While there, I got a chance to see The Usual Suspects. What a great film. The ending was amazing, even though someone had already told me how it ended. I was surprised all the same. AH!  People keep instant messaging me while I am trying to do this essay. I'm going to put up an away message so they will leave me alone for a while. My mother called me this afternoon to tell me that the product I ordered online came in the mail. I need to go pick it up. It was my first order on eBay. A friend of mine and I really like PROPNAME PROPNAME, so I found some LOCNAME LOCNAME team jerseys with his name on the back online for only $00 a piece. We have been waiting about 0 weeks for them to come in the mail, but I guess that isn't that long considering they were being shipped from LOCNAME. I hope they are in good condition. I mean, for $00, one would assume they are in total disarray. I hope not. I really want a PROPNAME jersey. Wow, I am really writing about absolutely nothing. This assignment is awesome!  Now I'm listening to a Dave Matthews Band song. \"The Song That Jane Likes\". I just started liking ORGNAME only about 0 years ago. My best friend idolizes them and plays all their songs on his guitar. PROPNAME is an awesome guitar player. I wish he was with me here at UT. I really miss him. He is back at home, while everyone else we know moved on to college. I feel bad for him. I wish he would move to LOCNAME with me. He works at ORGNAME and is trying to raise enough money for him to go to school. I love ORGNAME. I used to always get a caramel macchiato, but now I really like Irish cream cafe mochas. Those are very good. I have not really had any time to go to ORGNAME. There's one in the bottom floor of Jester LOCNAME, but its just not the same as an actual cafe house. PROPNAME and I would regularly hang out at the ORGNAME by us for hours on end. We would talk or play cards or chess. I really miss that. Its okay though, he is coming to visit soon, and I will be going home for his birthday in a couple of weeks. It should be fun. I'm really excited about that. \nAsnwer:"
