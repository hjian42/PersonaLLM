No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: \"no, I don't want your number, no, I don't want to give you mine and no, I don't want to meet you somewhere, no, I don't want none of your ti-ime. \" (the song that is in my head) I am worried that I lost a green piece of paper, among other things. sigfried and roy. I am eating wheat thins. zucini. go fly a kite. there is an antropology major on this floor. my back itches. 'she sells sanctuary'. my roomate talks, talks, talks. my philosophy prof. likes to drop the chalk. \"no, nosy-girl, go look at the door\" (that's what I just said) she's a hobbit-girl. I like it when people breakdance. I regret that I have only one blah to give for my country. all my friends talk about is records and porn. I'm trying to hide the fact that I like ska and very confused about what I should be. I only pretend to know everything, really I don't believe anything. it's easier that way. I don't like pepsi. ut gives me pimples and blisters. I don't want to get my wisdom teeth extracted because I don't want to like medicine. I'm black at night and white during the day, my door says so. I'm thinking that I may have a vague headache. my eye don't want to be open. dammit I'm not thinking about anything at all. chicken coops and grey days. saris. \"rollercoaster of love\" they don't make beef alphabet soup anymore and that sucks. red old shack and a cow in the back. my roomate has a lumpy forehead and she prays funny. blah blah blah. saturn is my favourite planet. \"the faces she's watching, she's watching the faces. \"   \nAsnwer:"
