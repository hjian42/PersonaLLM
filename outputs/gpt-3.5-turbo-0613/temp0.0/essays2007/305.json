While sitting here I realize how much my life is different in LOCNAME rather than two hundred and eighty miles away in LOCNAME. For example, I always had someone to do my laundry there and if I did it myself I never had to wait for a washing machine. PROPNAMEhe thing I miss most about LOCNAME is not having my friends around. Even though my best friend and my girlfriend are also attending PROPNAME T and both are staying in Jester I still miss my other friends a lot. I always thought when I came to Austin it was going to be so much fun, but now I realize there is a lot of work involved. Only a week has gone by since I got here and I already have so much to do. That is another thing I miss about home, the ability to do nothing if I so desire. Here \"doing nothing\" is not an option. I feel that if I do nothing I will fall behind and just be wasting time. I miss the little things about home. Even though my girlfriend lives here I miss being able to go to each others house. Sure we can go to each others dorm rooms but I miss the feeling of home and hanging out with her family and mine. That is another thing I have not mentioned yet, I miss my family. I honestly did not think I would but I do. I guess over time I will grow accustomed to living here and maybe eventually be able to call Austin my home. Well, it's time to put the clothes in the dryer so I guess this is the end. \nAsnwer:"
