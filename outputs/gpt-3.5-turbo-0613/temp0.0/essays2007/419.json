I need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now I'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will I ever get some sleep. Not if I have to keep typing this damn assignment. But who needs sleep anyway I wondering if I have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. Two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am I to judge people for being nasty. My girlfriend just said that I'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. I need to be working so I can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that I have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which I'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because I don't have enough time to study since I have to work to. Oh I'm wondering if they are going to open the UT Tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. I don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. It has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. But live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. My significant other is wondering what I'm typing right now, so I am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that I just typed about 00 minutes ago. Anyway, I'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so I have to go chase her so that I can return her safely to the ocean. Alright then bye know because I've been typing for twenty minutes and I need to go smoke a cigarette. \nAsnwer:"
