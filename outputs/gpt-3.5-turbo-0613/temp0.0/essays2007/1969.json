I guess that's because it was the first\" actual weekend that my friends and I actually went out and \"explored\" LOCNAME. I know that we have been here for two weeks already and haven't \"explored\" PROPNAME, but I think it was better this way. The first weekend we didn't want to go home and deal with all the emotional issues that we had dealt with just two weeks ago. It was also weird this weekend because not one ORGNAME our friends was with us. She had in a way \"made new\" friends, which is alright with me and everything it is just that she was trusting them as soon as she heard that they wanted to go and party in Austin. What was really scary was that last night my friend went out with these girls that she has only know for a week and they went drinking at some party. I don't mind the drinking issue or her not hanging out with her old friends from high school, it's just that she was leaving Austin (the party was in LOCNAME LOCNAME) and the driver said she wasn't going to drink a lot. I was kind ORGNAME in awe that my friend left with people when the designated driver was even drinking. I feel that even if the designated driver has at least one drink than that person shouldn't drive. I guess that's what this whole college experience is all about. People are responsible for making their own decisions here. No one is here to tell them what to do and no one should. These people are adults now and can think for themselves. I also know that another reason I didn't want to or even want to go home until I really have to is to deal with the emotional issues ORGNAME leaving my family, especially my mom. I know that I'm close to my father and my younger sister, but it seems that every time I talk to her on the phone or when she came to visit last Thursday, I felt like I needed to cry. I don't know why I felt like that. I know that we're very close but I really don't want to deal with that issue of me not being able to let go of my childhood and become that adult that my parents have tried to raise me to be. I also have another worry on my mind. One of my guy friends had be accepted to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME and he was rooming with my best friend's boyfriend and according to them, everything was great. My guy friend had been dating this girl for the past four months now and she had helped him move in and settle. And this past summer they had spent, from they told my friends and I, nearly every day together. Or if they weren't together, they at least had talked to each other one the phone for a couple of hours. To me that sounds kind of like they couldn't leave each other alone or trust each other but I don't know if that would be normal because I haven't really been in a relationship like that. Well to continue with my worry, according to my best friend's boyfriend, our guy friend had been kind of sad about missing his girlfriend (she is going to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME). Every time his girlfriend would call him, he would get sad. And my best friendn's boyfriend would try and get him out of the room and go around the campus, and he would be happy, however as soon as she called, he would get sad again. And of course we all understood that him missing her was normal. Well the ORGNAME of ORGNAME started two days before we did and that Monday night our friend had been talking to his girlfriend and was mad because he had missed her. Well apparently she gave him her credit card number and he took a plane flight to LOCNAME. And he told my best friend's that he was never coming back. What we don't understand is why he decided that. This is his first relationship and they already have given each other \"a promise ring\" or a \"promise gift\" because she gave him a realy expensive watch with a diamond in it and he gave her the ring. What my friends and I don't understand is what is going on through his head. Well my time is almost up. I have like ten seconds left so I guess that's it. \nAsnwer:"
