Thank goodness PROPNAME has  this lap top so I can do this assignment. I still have to do the other one too. They both are due Friday. The lights just came on. I'm so relieved because now I can feel the air conditioning. I'm a little bit off the assignment because PROPNAME is watching me. PROPNAME says hi. she is really sick right now and her nose is always runny. she snotted on my bed. or maybe she just drooled. I don't really know. Tonight I need to go to the theta house and study. We have to get certain amount of hours done . I don't really want to read anymore of the LOCNAME LOCNAME by PROPNAME. It is like a history book. It  makes me want to fall asleep sometimes when I read it. The most interesting section was about the animals on the Plains. The little jackrabbit has a white patch on its butt so that whenever it is in danger or something it flares it up to communicate with it's own kind. I guess that's how it works. Right now it's talking about the north vs. the south and it is way boring. I have about 00 pages  to read tonight. It is a little overwhelming. sometimes I get behind  and feel real guilty about it because I want to keep up with all my classes. I need to do my math homework too. I kind of just feel like taking a nap until we go study but then I'll never get up. My bed is sooooooo  cozy. I just put on some pink sheets and they rock because they are soo soft. I kind of feel like watching Backdraft. Whichever PROPNAME guy is in it is really good looking. He reminds me of this LOCNAME guy that is living in  towers. He is really good looking obviously and really sweet too. He walked us home the other night from the LOCNAME house because he thought it was too dangerous. then he started talking about what church he went to. I was thinking this guy is too good to be true. But then someone told me that he had just broken up with his long time girlfriend because they are at separate colleges. I don't think I would like to get in the middle of that. If that's the only reason why they broke up then that's not enough. Because obviously they had something big to hold onto and not let go of just like that. But he is one of the better guys  I've seen around lately. I kind of want to just ver out tonight but I know that I'll feel bad about it later. I'm so into making good grades but I haven't quite gotten into the hang of doing homework in this new setting and everything. PROPNAME just called. I'll be living with her next year. I think it\u2019ll be good. Me , PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. I don't really know her too too well. Seh and PROPNAME are friends. PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and I have been hanging out a lot lately. She's so cool. It's really awesome to get to know people from different states and become close friends. She's from LOCNAME. LOCNAME is so random. What is in LOCNAME?  Maybe we'll all go there to see her family sometime. We might go to LOCNAME for The Rice game. Then I'll get to see my little brother. He is so cool. He's growing like a weed right now. It's crazy. Now that I'm gone he is like an only child. I hate that for him. Maybe he likes it a little. He gets all the attention now. I don't want to lose the awesome brother/sister relationship  that  we have right now because I'm 0 hours from home. \nAsnwer:"
