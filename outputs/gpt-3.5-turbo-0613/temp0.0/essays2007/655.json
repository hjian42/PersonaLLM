No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: At the moment I I can seem to think about is how strange it is to think about what I'm thinking about. I'm not really sure if I can truley display my thoughts if that's what I'm concentrating on instead of letting my mind wander subconsiously. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, but it does to me. I'm trying to fight the temptation to go back and reword/correct sentences. Its very strange. I'm also trying not to have more than a two seconds pause between words/sentences so that I can show a true, 00 minute, unbroken stream of thought. I can't , unfortunately, fight the urge to correct typos - its natural for me to press the delete key the oment I see a mistake pop up on the screen. It will be interesting, however, to read this when I'm finished and see how many mistakes I missed. My roomate just put a CD on that I haven't heard in a long time - it makes mee think about highschool (the last time I listened to this)  what is it called?   . Oasis I think  you, and the name of the song is \"Wonderwall\"  I sincerely hope that its just a TA reading this and not Dr. PROPNAME because I'll probably be embarrased at my grammar usage/sentence structure, ect. ect. Did you know (I'm sure you do) that \"etcetara\" is Latin for \"and so forth\"  I know this because I took Latin in high school. It was a complete waste of time. I only got little useless trivial pieces of infromation out of it. Thought my favorite insult is still \"habitas familia in miser villa\" (you and your family live in a miserable farmhouse)  Our teacher left midway through our senior year and so they had a spanish teacher named Mr. PROPNAME teach the class. Kind of funny because he didn't know Latin, but hey, actually knowing the language is just optional right?  Latins dead anyway. hehe  It just occured to me that this is actually how I type a , drat, phone. k, that was my girlfriend, PROPNAME. we're not having the best of time, though I'm sure (I hope) we'll work it out. I pondered writing during the phone conversation but that would be weird (especially for PROPNAME) because I seriously doubt I can type and talk at the same time. unless I type giberish. or talk giberish; either of which would be bad in their own right. what was I talking, er. tyiping about before?  I actually had to scan up the page to read and remember - it was email. I was thinking about how I actually type a lot of emails like this - not really without thinkg about what I'm saying and not looking for grammar and all that but just typing continously. Usually because I'm emailing like 0 different people and it takes to long and its annoying. speaking of annoying, this is taking a long time  Its amazing how long 00 minutes can go by when you're thinking what else you could be doing. we're going to play risk in about 00 minutes. I love Risk. I'm not sure really, there's just somethin strangely fun about taking over the world. I also play this game on my computer called \"Civilization, Call to Power\" which is wonderfullly complex and very challenging. You build a civilization from 0000bc to 0000ad and either try to beat the computer opponents economically and in number of scientific andvances (kind of on a point system) or attempt to take over the world. In my currect game I have eliminated 0 of the 0 computer oppents and I'm going for the kill on my last enemy, the Persians. I made the mistake of using nuclear weapons and now my populace is very angry at me because of nuclear fallout and all that garbage. How many people have actually tried to take over the world?  0?  PROPNAME, PROPNAME and PROPNAME. All failed. I wonder if its even possible. Probably not, especially when your enemies have nukes. Nukes are kind of scary, I try not to think about them. Ok, thats 00 minutes FINALLY! \nAsnwer:"
