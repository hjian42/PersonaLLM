I know I was confused about what to do, but there is really no confusion to it. is there? I don't know why I am talking to the computer like it is really going to talk back to me. Well, what am I thinking. I first want to know why it is so darn cold in all of these buildings, like I am about to freeze now in the computer lab at LOCNAME, and my roommate is talking to me about her boyfriend coming to see her today. Hell, I hate men right about now, because my man and I broke up a few weeks ago, before I came to school because he can't handle being in a serious relationship, that just happens to be long distance. I just don't know what the problem is. I mean if I am capable of being faithful, which has come pretty hard for me in the past, then I can be in a committed relationship. God, I need to get these nails off of my fingers because I keep messing up and having to backspace all the time. I think I'll get them soaked off tomorrow, after I get my navel pierced. I must seem like a really superficial person considering some of the things that are running through my mind. My fingers are starting to hurt because I am having to work extra hard because I have on these freaking nails. I just saw the number one in the tower on the computer screen that this boy just showed me. He looked so young, and he was actually kind of cute, but not tall enough. I know I just said that I hate men, but that was a lie. I can't live without them. Especially the tall ones that play basketball or run track or something. God, I want a man! I wonder how I would sound of I started talking all philosophical and stuff. I am not the type to go into deep analytical thinking, and I bet you are say, then why are you in my class. I think that the you are cool. I mean Prof. PROPNAME seems to be cool, but anyway. I am so bored right now, I have to braid this dude's hair, and I kind of don't want to, but he's going to pay me and I need some money, soon, and there is some back to school thing in the business atrium tonight. I guess I will go for a little while, not too long because I have a class at 000 in the morning, and it just happens to be calculus, and my damn teacher can't even speak english all the way. Why would the math department of all departments have teachers that students can't understand? I don't freaking get it. It's one of the hardest subjects at this school, and someone that is a first year teacher and can't speak english is teaching the class. WHY? Are the powers that be trying to torture me? Well, whatever happens, I will stay prayed up and depend on the lord to help me through this tough class. I just thought about something, I am not going to be able to go home this weekend because my parents are going to LOCNAME for Labor Day to visit my auntie PROPNAME, and my Uncle PROPNAME. I wonder how Precious is doing. I hope she still isn't messing with that idiot PROPNAME, like I think she still is. when will she ever learn, men that pray on you, and want all of your money, and wreck your car are not good boyfriend material. I mean, I know that I have had some trouble in the past dealing with idiot men, but I learned my lesson. I want to find me someone to act right and help me along the way when I need it. Is that too much to ask for? Gee, I can go on and on about men, and the experience s that I have had with them, but that is old and I am in a new place, and have to meet new men, and make new friends and most of all make awesome grades so that I can be on the dean's list like I want to be, and make the cheerleading team this year is going to prove to be a great one, and I hope that the lord blesses me do do well in all that I do this year and my years to come. I know that I am capable of doing it all, but I just want to survive. This city is filled with opportunity, and it's all mine for the taking!  \nAsnwer:"
