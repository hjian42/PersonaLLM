No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: college is perhaps the most unstructed, yet the most structured enviornment I have yet to face. Vague, vague, it's all vague, yet so remarkably specific. I can't help but thing about what I'm going to say next. I'm engaged in an activity, that's how I work. When I'm doing something, I try to do it with the most focus I can. To simply do it with no thought is, to me, a waste of mind. Back to college, I'm still trying to convince myself that I had no choice. Had I given myself the option, I would be a music major, but I didn't do what I had to do. I slacked off on my music, a thing I can never forgive myself for. Sure, in that time, I managed to develop my other skills in school, but what a becauset. I played viola for seven years to major in chemistry. Sure, some may say that just having played is enough, but for me, to not bring about one's work to full potential is not worth anything. I hope I go through with chemistry, then at least I can say I stuck with something. Listening to music right now, I think that perhaps I could have achieved that; maybe I still can, but it seems to far right now. at least the food is good, and my roommate is a nice person. I guess college will just be a test of how much I want to make a good life for myself. it's my brother; I'm so glad to talk to him; I had to leave him in the middle of the hardest part of his life (middle school); he was really used to having me there, but it seems like he's adapting fine. I hated my middle school years. The kids we mean and the teachers we less than happy to help out a shy little guy like I was. thankfully, high school was much better. College seems like it will be full of wonderful interaction, but I wonder how much interaction I'll be able to stand. I'm the kind of person who likes other people, but who also sees them as a distraction most of the time. and they always seem to distract when you don't want them to and disappear when you want company. I'll never figure people out. Well, this has been a lot of uncohesive thought, but I guess that's the whole point. adieu and farwell \nAsnwer:"
