I learned that the hard way. So far, here at LOCNAME, computers have been quite a pain in the ass. My password for UT access won't work. Maybe because its nine letters. I can't tell; the instruction sheet said that you're password should be up to 0 letters, not that it had to be at least eight letters. Here in LOCNAME should means has to, I guess. Sir PROPNAME is gone, I guess. He did that PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME song, and then he disappeared, unless you\u2019re a hardcore rap fan. I once read about some little down in the LOCNAME where a bunch of rappers lived and made music. Like PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME lives in LOCNAME, LOCNAME, where I went to summer camp one year. We called ourselves the Homies, and had an old cowboy hat called the Homie Hat. Some guy in another tee-pee shot it up at Riflery one day, so we had a funeral service, of which I was the preacher. We made am H out of rocks above the hole where we placed the hat and said a prayer. The counselor said it was sacrilegious, but we went through with it anyway, and later dug it up and moved it because we thought some one was going to grave-dig it. That\u2019s a great piece of trivia in my life- Where ids the HOmie Hat buried?  Someday, maybe I'll go visit PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and we'll go up to ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME camp along the banks of the ice-cold LOCNAME LOCNAME and find that H. That would be cool. When I was younger we went to the Monahns in LOCNAME LOCNAME, whenever we were visiting my grand-parents in LOCNAME. Now my mom and grandmother are in a big tiff over a pins shower cap in the upstairs shower. Its a silly fight, of course, but I guess its kind of interesting to see who gives in and talks to the other first. My favorite tiff ever was the Tongs-Becky tiff of late 0000. It involved car accidents, lies, rumors, name-callings. Now Tongs goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME, in the Big Sky conference, which brings me back to tiffs. I knew this girl at ORGNAME ORGNAME's named PROPNAME who had a friend she hadn't seen in a long time who went to ORGNAME ORGNAME, which I think is in the Big Sky. So I told her that next time she emails her she should mention that she knew someone in LOCNAME who had a friend who was going to another Big Sky school. I don't think she ever intended to do it, but she emailed her anyway, and this Southern LOCNAME girl never wrote back. I guess she'll never know about the whole Big Sky? LOCNAME coincidence, unless PROPNAME told her, which I rather improbable. She obviously didn't care. PROPNAME stole PROPNAME PROPNAME's straw cowboy hat, which is now sitting right in front of me as I write. PROPNAME PROPNAME, from LOCNAME, was playing at the LOCNAME LOCNAME, where we saw him a year before and when he crowd-surfed, PROPNAME just yanked it off his head. It was badass. PROPNAME says he doesn't feel bad about it. I wonder if PROPNAME misses that old hat. I think he does, but he learned a valuable lesson, like when PROPNAME PROPNAME lost his guitar, and found it at some bar in LOCNAME LOCNAME a year later. That story is probably bullshit, as most of PROPNAME PROPNAME's seem to be. It doesn't matter- I don't pay to hear storied from an era in his life that he probably really doesn't remember, but I do wish he's play a bigger variety of songs- the man has released over 00 albums- all different, yet plays the same set at every concert. I've never even heard Pot Can't Call the ORGNAME ORGNAME, and that\u2019s one of his biggest songs anyway,. You want stories, talk to old PROPNAME- his stories pretty much suck, but his pride in telling them is what is so interesting. He makes a walk from LOCNAME to the LOCNAME LOCNAME sound fascinating, while I almost get lost lost-to-death in some God-forsaken part of LOCNAME LOCNAME, and I can't even keep people listening. \nAsnwer:"
