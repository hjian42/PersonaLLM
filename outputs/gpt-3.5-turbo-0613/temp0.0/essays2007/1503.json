I'm about to start studying for Chemistry and Psychology so I do have a bit of work to do tonight. In Chemistry I need to do the homework and also the work for the discussion session. I'm almost done with the psychology chapter I've been reading all week. It's the most interesting book I've been reading, followed by biology, then chemistry. All of it kind of ties in together though which helps out a lot. Today I met a lot of people from my freshman interest group, which is kind of nice because I haven't met many people due to me living in an apartment. My phone line finally came in today after a week of waiting so I'm just now able to get on the internet, which I've sorely missed. It was pretty tiring moving all of my roommates and my furniture to our apartment because we're on the third floor. I have enjoyed school a lot more than usual so far, probably because it is actually interesting compared to high school. I'm glad someone picked up my shift at the LOCNAME tomorrow to give me more study time, and also it helps because my car is in the shop and it was going to be hard to leave psychology at 0 and be dressed and ready for work at 0, especially without a car. I want to do the pretesting for the psych labs but the net is giving me a broken link. Oh well, I guess I'll do it later and maybe it will be fixed. I just got everything in my apartment organized today. I bought some hanging folders for all of my handouts, which are really helping, and other various organizers. I kind of like this assignment, I'm doing work but it's over what I'm thinking at the time and let's me see my thoughts. It's kind of like a recap of the day, because that's mainly what's on my head. Hopefully tomorrow I'll wake up on time considering that this morning I woke up at 0:00 and had to high tail it to my chemistry class by 0:00. Oh well, it's been about 00 minutes so I'm going to go ahead and study now for my classes. It was fun. \nAsnwer:"
