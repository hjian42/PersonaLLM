No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have heard of assignments like this one before, but never thought that I would sit at my computer for 00 minutes just typing away. but, thats what you want so here I go: hmmmm, I have a lot of work to get done, I need to get my girlfriend's birthday card written and sent out, her bday is on the 00th of this month. we have an interesting relatiosnship. she is going to AM next year so that makes me wonder a little, also, my parents don't know we are together, they would never accept her since she is white. I think thats bull shit personally. I have told my parents they are prejudice, they don't understnad that term I think. yeah, but we broke up before I went to LOCNAME this year so that we could just be friends but she doesn't think that fbeing fiends is right. she says either we get back together or don't weven talk anymore, so I got back together. I think it was like an ultimatum, she says that normal human beings would react the way that she did. I question that, heck, you could probably tell me since you're a psychology professor with a ph. d. in something related to psychology I assume. hmmmm, I think we are going to break up, just makes sense, but I don't want to hurt her and who kn ows, she maybe that ONE person and I may be throwing that away, which is a dumb thing to do. yeah, well, I also have lots of reading to do which I better get started on soon. my roommate and suitemate have gone to the library at least every other day and have done all there reading, but I haven't doneany of it. in high school, I never had to bother with any of that. the day before the test, iw oudl read up and be set. I know that won't work here proabbly but yet I still don't take the initiative to read. I think I may just be lazy, or I may tghink too much of myself and find mysefl screwed come sept. 00 since thats my first test, or its spet 00, eithe ron. e   hmmmm, man, dobie food sucks a lot, I ts good I guess but its just that I get so used to it and I hate standing in line. ,. yup yup. theres a lot of dumb bullshit things also, luike I have a friedn tht tells me \"oh, man, be careful when you hang out with them, they blah blah blah and all this. \"  they don't do anythingillegal, they just party or have minor problems if anythuing. let em figure tht out you know, she is quick to give me her opinon and I don't even ask for it. ppl that I respect because the hyave been successful, she says man, he is full of shit. whatevefr, he gets his stuff done and is very scuccessful (I am having a lunch meteting with him to figure out the stuff I should be doing and joining etc. ) and she thinks that he is jsut full of shit. I don't care really to hear it but I can't tell her to shut the *(& up because thats also wrong. sometimes, the situation demands to be mean or atleast abrasive, but thats difficult (not beacuse I don't know how to, I do, I am a former debater) but because its nott eh impression I wantt o give out. well I am getting tired right now, but there is only a few minutes left so I might as well continute. hmmmm, not much else is going on here. yeah there is this big thing about going and partying and drinking and etc,. definitely not my sceneinking, never done it, no inteention to, I just don't want to, but there is definitely pressure created when your firends (Since like age 0) are doing it, and then you wonder why not, might as well. hmmmm, I strill haven't but then again, I have gone home to houston every weekend so far to visit my mom and make sure everything is okay sin e no one else is home (my dad is in india of r business ) and I also went home to see alsion (my girlfriend of 0. 0 years)  that myb the reason she wants to saty together or not even get together, I think she is too attached (she says she loves me more than she has ever loved) she is my first girlfriend ( I love her, I think ) what is love? its a personal point of view that can nver be defined. there are too many differntt types of love, and then even romantic love is interpreted differently. I thinks thats weird. I have siad I love you and so has she but we may mean (although same principle) two completely different things. I think thats interesting. well, thats it my 00 miutes are up, I have been watching ORGNAME and typing at the same time, and man, there a bunch of fine girls at LOCNAME, but I don;t think I will get any of them (oh well, I have alison and I don';t want any of thme rright now, buts its nice to know that you could get those irls if youw ant to you know) oh well, thats me thinkin gabout sex again. hehehhe. thats it, enjoy this, I certainly did typing it. see  you (keep this confidential -- I must assume it is) \nAsnwer:"
