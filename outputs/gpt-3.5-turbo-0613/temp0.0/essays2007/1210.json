    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am so overwhelmed that I don't even know what to do anymore. If it isn't one subject then it is another. I finally think that I am ahead in at least once subject and then I look at the syllabus and it says that I am, in actuality, 0 chapters behind. I really don't understand how this all happens. I thought that when I came to college it would be different. I thought that I would get to have a fresh start at things. I thought I would be able to make myself study and get ahead; however, my predictions are proving to be wrong. I am getting further and further behind with every passing day. I have psychology chapters to read, interpersonal communications chapters to read, contemporary moral problems readings, psychology writing assignments, MIS homework and readings. Even if I had all my time to study I still wouldn't be able to get it all done. But that isn't even the issue. Not only do I have all of these things to do, but there are also people asking me every five seconds to go out and enjoy LOCNAME. I don't have time to enjoy Austin. I don't have time to go out, go to sorority meeting, read, write, and keep my sanity all in one day. There just is not enough time. I try and try to manage my time, but it just is not working. I think my only solution is to lock myself in my room and not come out until all of my work for the rest of the semester is done. That is my only solution to my ongoing problem. \nAsnwer:"
