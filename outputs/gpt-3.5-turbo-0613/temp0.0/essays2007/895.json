No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Annoyance is about the only word I can think of at this moment to describe how I feel. Today has been awful. Why doesn't anything ever work out the way I wish it would? Everything I needed to accomplish today has been a filure> I can't find a job because I can't get on a computer because me UTeId is all out of wack. I miss my friends back home and I miss being a part of my family. They just seem to go on so wonderfully without me. I guess I am the one who wanted to move out and be independent, but it'd be nice to know they all still care about me and are concerned with how I'm doing. It's so hard being so alone all the time. I wish I were making more friends. I wish I would join an organization or I wish I had rushed. Maybe life would be more fun if I were in  a Sorority. Maybe I just wasn't cut out for college. I want to be grown up and finished with college and heve my career so badly. I'm tired of just meandering around with no real purposee in my life. I want to start my real life, and I know this can't be it because I'm not happy with it. I want to fall in love and marry and have a family and a meaningful job. I just needsome meaning in my life. I don't know what I'm here for. I know what I want to do with my life, but time is getting in my way and I'm angry because of it. And I'm hungry; physically and metaphorically speaking. this cannot be the way college will be forever. It's so much worse thatn High school. It's so big. It intimidates me to think that there are more poeple on the Ut campus thatn live in my home town. I have a class that has twice as many pople than I graduated with in it. It's a real shock. It's traumatizing to go from being well known and well loved to not being either one at all. It hurts deep down and is extremely depressing and discouraging. But I shouldn't let it get me down, I should hang on to the confidence I've still got, because it's the only thing that can get me through \"the best years of my life\". Yeah, right. \nAsnwer:"
