No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: A picture of my girlfriend PROPNAME sits on top of my desk to the left of my computer. She is beautiful in many ways. Her eyes look a little odd in this particular picture, however. I'll tell her that next time I talk to her. My cousin PROPNAME is getting married in October. He is been living with his girlfriend for quite a while. When I asked him how he felt about getting married, he told me that things would be much different since he is been living with his girlfriend. It should be much different though because now he would have taken vows and promised himself to her and vice versa. It'll be awesome. The wedding will be a lot of fun. I'll dance with PROPNAME and such. And I'll have all my family there. Well, a lot of my family because it's impossible to unite all of my family. Too big. 00 first cousins, etc. I remember when my sister got married. Good times. I got to wear an awesome sleek-looking tux. My uncle (PROPNAME's dad) took a cool digital picture. My feet are cold. I'm not gunna put on a second pair of socks though, because I don't want to wash an extra pair of socks. PROPNAME, my roommate is playing guitar. He is playing a solo that we recorded on PROPNAME PROPNAME' recording. We recorded and collaborated with PROPNAME. Good times. I hope he is happy with it. I'll ask him next time I'm in LOCNAME LOCNAME. PROPNAME is wonderful. I can't wait to see her next month. I hope all the flight arrangements work out and such. It should. And then I'll be able to embrace her like I did this past summer. What an amazing summer, all because I loved her like I should. Honestly, faithfully, humbly, with integrity and with all my soul. We're awesome because we reciprocate each other without having to put effort into it. Everything is willing. Everyday I see so many people in horrible relationships or pathetic relationships. But PROPNAME and I are so far past that. And we both know it. And we both appreciate it and don't take it for granted. I love her. I'm proud of that because I know I love better than most if you even call what most do love. PROPNAME and I are working on a new song. It's going to rock. PROPNAME, you're distracting me. Half over. 0:00 am. I need to read, but I'll do that tomorrow. He is still playing the guitar. He is asking me musical questions but I am busy. Stream of Consciousness! Yay. Homework. ORGNAME for school. Yahoo for me. *shrugs*\" - billy madison. Great movie. I have it memorized and I recited it in front of PROPNAME in 0th grade when he challenged that I couldn't recite it. Good times. I wonder how PROPNAME's doing. He is probably smoking or drinking right now. What an admirable class president. PROPNAME was student body president. good guy. I'll see him on american idol one of these days. My neck itches and I scratched it. My calves are cold now. *stretching calves*  mmm. cow. Reminds me of steak. Yum. I could eat a juicy steak right about now. *drools*  \"Mmmm. homemade prosac. mmm. organized crime\" - homer simpson. It would be hilarious and awesome to be a vigilante, that is, if I wouldn't feel bad about hurting people for my own reasons rather than society's ethics or their own morals. But if I were a local vigilante, I'd hang out on Speedway in the middle of the bicyle-dismount-zone and I'd push over all the people who passed by me still on their bikes. \"Bicycle dismount zone, punk!\" heh. That's be cool. Then they would get up and beat me up. I remember when I use to spend the night at PROPNAME's house back in 0th,0th grade and in the morning his dad would bring us donuts sometimes because he worked night shifts. but sometimes we would eat cereal. I never eat breakfast anymore. and his bowls would have straws built-into them and you could suck the milk when you were done. that was the first time I saw one of those. they were  \nAsnwer:"
