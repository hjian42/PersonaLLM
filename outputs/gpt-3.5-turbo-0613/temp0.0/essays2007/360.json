No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Adjusting to the classes, increased freedom and increases in \"having a good time\" have all been fairly easy to get used to. Meeting new people has been exciting and the \"name game of trying\" to remember everyone I have met has been a challenge. This Labor Day weekend I saw the huge different between high school and college as I decided to take a road trip with three other friends to LOCNAME, a popular Labor Day hangout. I don't know if it was the college parties that made  the night we were there seem dull or just that several key things were missing that usually made the time memorable. Seeing my younger friends made me feel out of place, and talk of curfew violations almost made me laugh. One thing is for sure those times are over and  getting further away, but also new and improved times are ahead. This weekend has also showed me that I am a very patient person. My roommate PROPNAME has shown this to me. Having my windshield broken, being almost evicted from our apartment and being irresponsible are just a few of my things my roommate has done this weekend. If I am still sane at the end of the year I think that I will be a stronger person, because of having to deal with PROPNAME. I feel the classes are picking up as professors start talking about future exams. O, I almost forgot to mention my goals for this year (in no specific order)- get good grades (a 0. 0), not get fatter, stupider, not get into too much trouble and have a blast. Basically I hope to work hard and play hard. \nAsnwer:"
