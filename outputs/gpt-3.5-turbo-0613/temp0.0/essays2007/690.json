I really didn't think I would miss home that much, but apparently I do. Seriously, I cannot wait to go in the car and drive back to LOCNAME. But it's not like I am homesick. Well, actually I guess I am homesick, but it's not for my family. To be quite honest, everytime I talk to my mother, she annoys me. But what I do miss is my bed. Not the house, because we don't' live in the house anymore. NO, we have to move two months before I leave for college. What were my parents thinking???  Obviously they weren't. But I do miss LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really want to go back to MY room. But, now I have no room. Honestly, I do not consider my dorm room MY room. Thinking of, I definitely need to bring back some more stuff. Pictures and frames - stuff like that. My room mate brought so much crap. It makes my side of the room look so bare. But at the same time, I DID bring a lot of stuff. Anyways, this weekend. My date with PROPNAME. I really don't want to go at all. I know that I completley led him on. I mean I could have told him that I was joking, but I didn't. I basically told him that I liked him. BUT PROPNAME PROPNAME! - UGH!  I still sound like I am totally in highschool. I know that in college you are supposed to throw away all your passt conceptions of people, but how can I do that about the guy who teased me for like 0 years. How many times can you say, \"But Mr. PROPNAME, I'm only eleven?\"  and think it to be funny. I swear in seventh grade I could have shot him and PROPNAME PROPNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME is another boy, who I would never ever date. When he got to be such a heart throb in high school is beyond me. But then again, I never ever thought that I would have a crush on PROPNAME. I am such a hypocrit. The amount of time I was telling PROPNAME, not to like him and not to go for him. But then again, PROPNAME and PROPNAME would not have lasted anyways. Gio is so prude, PROPNAME would have either dumbed her or cheated on her pretty quickly. Gosh, I really hope that this assginment is completion, or else you will think that I am a really shallow and superficial person. Not to meniton judgemental. But actually what can you expect coming from ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME - thrid snobbiest school in the nation???  I seriously had fun at high school, but it definitley was a different type of fun than the type of fun I'm having now. I mean in high school I hardly ever drank really, until my senior year. But even then it wasn't EVERY weekend like I do now. I mean, we used to do stupid stuff like go to the airport and play airport tag, wrap or in the case of PROPNAME \"condimenting\" houses. But now, it's frat parties every weekend. Not that I am complaining, because I am hanging out with PROPNAME - what a hottie. But he is so rude. and PROPNAME - honestly, I havent' talked to her since 0th grade. It is so wierd how people who were so close are now so far appart. But anyways, maybe the frat parties and the drinking is what is making me so tired, because I am pretty sure that I had less sleep that I am having now in highschool. Is this even stream of consciousness??? I ended up talkign about the same thing I began with, but I guess it is because I did go off on several tangents. But oh well - time's up! \nAsnwer:"
