I wonder what I'm going to do tomorrow. I need to wash my clothes and do all my homework. Those Rugby Little Sisters are strange girls and they have weird parties. Where's PROPNAME? My roommate is talking to me. She says I need to keep some of my thoughts to myself. I guess maybe that's true. I don't want to do homework. I just want to go to the football game this weekend and not have to worry about grades. I hope that freaky guy isn't going to be at the party on Saturday. He might try something on me again. I like this song, it makes me think of going to LOCNAME. I don't like my Biology 000 professor, she doesn't teach very well and I don't know how I'm supposed to pass her damn class if she keeps jumping around the book and not lecturing about what she needs to lecture about. She is too disorganized. I really need to wash my clothes and I need to workout tomorrow. My foot hurts, though. I really don't feel like running 00 miles tomorrow. That sucks. I wonder what PROPNAME's doing. Probably drinking. I can't wait to go home next month. It's funny, I'm not homesick, but I'm excited to go home. I want to go to LOCNAME. I kind of want to go to LOCNAME. I want to go everywhere. Wow, it's thundering a lot. I hope it doesn't rain on Saturday. I don't really feel like going to the rugby game tomorrow. I really need to study SOMETIME this weekend. sometime other than sunday. I'm so sleepy. I'm sleeping in tomorrow since I don't have class. I'm thirsty. I need to go buy more Diet Dr. Pepper. There just aren't enough hours in a day. I'm mad at PROPNAME. He still hasn't called me and he didn't even say goodbye to me. I thought he was more of a friend than that. Apparently not. Yuck. I need to wash my face and brush my teeth. I feel icky. That girl is STILL on the phone. And she probably wonders why she feels so homesick. Well, maybe if she had get off the phone she would actually have a life here. Being on the phone isn't going to help her at all. She is kind of bitchy too. She is just not friendly at all. Whatever. I hope Aryan's doing okay. Maybe I should call him. It's too late at home, though. Never mind. I have no idea what I want. I just can't let all my exes go. Maybe it's because I'm too immature or something. That's why I needed to get out of LOCNAME, so I could decide what I want with life. Here comes PROPNAME. Okay. I'm sick of the bathrooms here. I want my own bathroom. I hate it. The water here kind of smells funky too. I guess I'm used to more chlorinated water. I need to call PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I hope they get married. PROPNAME's wedding is on Saturday. Wow. She is only 00. I can't imagine being married in two years. That's way too soon. My hair color is awful. I want to go back to that salon and get that bastard to fix it. I mean, I spent a lot of money on crap. I should have told him right off that I hate it. I should be more confrontational. I have that issue. I need to fill up my water filter. I really want something to drink. Good. Only like five more minutes of this. My right shoulder has been hurting lately. It feels as if my vein or artery or whatever is going to burst. I need to get my meningitis vaccination. There's so much to do and I just don't have time to do it. That tickled. Oh! Virgo! That's me. What am I going to do next week for my birthday?  Who is PROPNAME?  Uh oh. \nAsnwer:"
