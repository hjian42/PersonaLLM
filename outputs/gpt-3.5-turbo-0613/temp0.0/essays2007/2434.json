No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I thought of a million different ways I would start this, and now  I can't think of any. Well,  one way, actually, was to say that this one time I had a conversation with my teacher about  whether people thought in complete sentences or not. I told her they didn't, but now I think  they do. That is, unless, they're answering questions. In thinking that it's hot, I don't think,  \"hot\" I think \"It's hot. \"  In any case, it's very cold in my room right now. My hands and feet are  especially cold. I wonder if that's simply because of the temperature of the room or that stress  stuff Dr. PROPNAME was talking about. Well the temperature used to be just fine, and now it's  cold all of the sudden. We have to call those eminence guys. They came last week and fixed  our toilet in like 00 seconds. We didn't even see them, we just heard them. I was joking with  my roommate that God came and fixed our toilet. God rocks. ha-ha I have a black t-shirt that  says that in white letters. It's my old youth group t-shirt. I designed it. I'm quite proud of that. It was cool and promoted God. One guy once came up to me and asked me if it was being  sarcastic. that wasn't cool. He felt bad after asking though, he said he didn't mean to be rude. I believe him. He was a cool guy in several of my classes. His name was PROPNAME. There was  this other guy named PROPNAME, too. He worked in the Emergency Room at the hospital where I  used to do my clinical rotations for school. He was really cool too. Actually me and my friend,  PROPNAME, that got along with him really well kept in touch with him. She just saw him recently at the  mall with his kids, and he told her some details about a friend of ours that died about three  weeks ago. He was in the emergency room when it happened. She was in a car accident and  died almost instantly. It was pretty sad, but it didn't really affect me personally because she  wasn't that close to me. However, my OA during orientation reminded me a lot of her, and  that's kind of eerie. I say a guy that was an OA this summer at school last week. That guy was  the one that stood out the most to me because he was the nicest looking. (Not as in attractive,  as in sincerely nice. )  Some people have that effect on me sometimes. Like recently I went to  LOCNAME and the guy that was the scuba diving instructor was named PROPNAME. PROPNAME was really  cool, and he had that effect on me. He just seemed like a sincerely nice guy. I'll probably  remember him for a while. I've had several people have that effect on me. It's interesting to  meet so many people around the world that are absolutely amazing, and they may not even  know it. They're absolutely amazing to me, and I don't even know why. It's awesome. I wish I  could keep in touch with someone halfway across the world for a long time. I need to find  someone first. Maybe if I get to study abroad in LOCNAME I'll find someone to keep in touch with. Things always seem to get in the way of stuff like that, every day life I guess. I don't know what  it is. I do have this one friend, PROPNAME, I've kept in touch with him for about two years now. I  met him at a medical program one summer, and we've kept in touch since. That summer I did  lots of stuff. I went to LOCNAME for World Youth Day, and I got to see the pope. Some people got  really emotional about that. They were crying and stuff. I kind of felt bad because I wasn't  crying, but I know there really is no reason I should feel guilty. God did not say, \"Thou shall be  overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing the pope and come to tears. \"  hah it would be kind of  funny if it said that in the bible. Anyway, that summer I also went to LDZ. That was one of the  greatest experiences ever. I've stumbled upon a few people here at LOCNAME that said, \"You were  governor at LDZ, right?\" It's pretty cool how lives cross. There are so many people at LOCNAME, who  wouldn't you find?  ha-ha The Monday before classes started I had an audition to try out for the  longhorn singers and we were in this tiny room in the music building, and who should walk in  the door but PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME himself!! LOCNAME It was hilarious!! He was apparently showing his  daughter around because she wanted to get in choir at LOCNAME. That's definitely a story worth  telling. I didn't recognize him. I'm to young I guess. I always figured PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME was white  only because I knew Vanilla Ice was. ha-ha  Anyway, this whole time I've been writing I've also  been thinking about PROPNAME PROPNAME (in one sentence) is the boy I've been in love with almost my  entire life. The reason why I've been thinking about him now is because a lot of the times I  write anything in journals or about what I'm thinking it's usually about him. I know this is  simply \"stream of consciousness\" but I guess I can't just write what I'm thinking without  thinking of him. Recently he wrote me an email after I hadn't emailed him in a while. I was  waiting for him to write me. It was short and mostly insignificant, but he wrote. I just want to  be friends, I think. I don't know what I want. I want to have lots of fun in college. I want to  experience life, then I can figure out what I want with him. It's probably not even my choice to  decided what I want with him. Anyway, another thing I also always thought about was whether  deaf people saw signs in there heads instead of heard words when they were thinking. \nAsnwer:"
