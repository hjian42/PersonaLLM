I'm never alone in my dorm because i'm always with my friend PROPNAME. Wow this is so weird. I used to be by myself all the time over the summer and now i am never alone. i guess its cool. i really don't know what to write. . i feel dumb. i have my music on really loud. hmmmm. i am missing my television show because i am doing this. but i have to do it now because i am going to the mall once i'm done!!! im so excited! i got $00 in gift certificates so i can't wait to spend them! my email thingy keeps flashing because i have new mail. too bad i can't check it. i probably should have checked it before i started this. oh well. i wonder how much my ebay stuff is going for now. i am watching some american idol stuff and i want to bid on them. . but i don't know how much itll be. i hope its not too expensive by now. im listening to avril lavigne. im going to the american idol concert in dallas on october 00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am SOOOOOOOOOOOO EXCITED!!!!!! we have great seats too. on the floor section. i've never been on the floor for an indoor concert. mosh pits are fun but i havent been in one for like 0 years. oh well. this song is so rockin. haha. i am so thirsty i am chugging a sunkist. weird. good thing no one is here to hear me burp since everyone thinks its gross! man! my other friends that go to ORGNAME think its cool! i need to go see them huh. oh well. gosh its only been 0 minutes. . hmmmmmm. . my favorite song is on. its called 'i'm with you' its soooo pretty. i feel so dumb writing this. i only type nonstop when i am writing to my best friends. and even then i feel dumb because my emails are so random and no one really understands them. but now this is homework so this is a little weird. what am i saying. gosh. my nose hurts a lil. don't know why. i doodled all over my hand today because i was so terribly bored. this song is so cool. too bad i can't sing it on this. but i can type the lyrics. haha. . i'm with yoooooooou. . its soooo pretty. avril lavigne is so awesome. she is like me but cooler! hahaha. i wish i could play the guitar. i really don't know what i'm saying. im so glad i can type fast or this would be terribly frustrating. i don't really type correctly though. . but as long as its fast i don't really care. lalallaalla. i don't know what to say. is this supposed to be grammatically correct. because mine isn't. . i started off capitalizing and stuff. haha gee what happened to that. my nose is so itchy!!! i hate that! my friend cynthia i was talking about got sick yesterday. so now im afraid that i will be too. meh. lalala i don't know what to say. hmm. my best friend dominique is online but i can't talk to her since i'm doing this!!! man! watch her leave. way to go! my nose is so itchy!!!! gosh!!! good thing my hands don't hurt from typing or i would quit! sunkist is so good. . i went to the store last week to go stock up on some more. but of course they didn't have any!!!!!!! so upsetting really. this is my last one!! i need to go get some. . hmmmmm. my room needs to be decorated more. hahaha its funny because my side of the room is completely covered with posters. and my roommate brittany's side only has pictures on the bulletin board and thats it. all the wall space is empty!! and here i am trying to use every inch possible to decorate. . its so unfulfilling because i wish i could say something ab her side but i don't know her so thats mean! oh well. that dumb amazing xcam0 pop up ad keeps coming up and its so annoying!!!! gosh!!! i really want to change my major! i need to do that! man! i really enjoyed my advertising class. . too bad i'm too shy to ever say anything. . i need to sit in the front. . because im too shy when im sitting in the back and i see everyone turning around and stuff. so yeah. i need to get there earlier because all the seats are always taken. gosh. too bad the class is so far away. lalallala. 00 minutes. . almost there. not really. i really feel dumb by doing this! have i mentioned that yet!!! i really want to check on my ebay stuff gosh. too bad tickets for the OU game are selling for soooo much money on ebay. i saw 0 tickets going for $000-000. thats soooooooo much! too bad my friends waited in line because they were number 00-something but it had been like 0 hours and they hadn't gotten anywhere so they ended up leaving. hahaha! isn't that sad yet funny! i can't wait until this weekend! or really till after i finish this. . i'm going to go to the mall. and use my gift certificates. and then i'm going to watch about a boy!!!! with hugh grant! i can't wait because i wanted to see that for so long. . man. oh well.  i don't know how i feel. tomorrow. . tomorrow.  this song is so pretty too. . i really miss my best friend. she goes to ORGNAME in denton. and i haven't seen her in like a month. we hardly talk really. its sad because i thought we would stay close. its so sad to think that we were so close but now its like ehhhhhh. she just seems so preoccupied. . and i used to call her every day. but now I've been telling myself not to because i always end up getting sad or mad or something. i hope i get over it soon. . that would be nice. how fitting. the song just said   i'm not ready. maybe tomorrow   wow. . don't you think that's a sign. . i have this thing and signs because i always see connections and it's just so awkward yet cool. . just like this. . i started talking about my best friend and then this song is on and talking about how   tomorrow it may change  . and i'm sad and depressed and how i want to move on. . wow. i'm impressed. . wow 00 minutes wasn't so bad. . i love this song too. i think you should get this album. its good. . ok well time is up now. . weeeeeee!!! ok.
