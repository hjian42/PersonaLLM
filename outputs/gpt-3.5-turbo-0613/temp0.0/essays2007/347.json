No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: My toes are kind of cold, no, they're very cold because this room is always frigid. At least I've got my flannel pants on that are so comfortable!  I love them. I could live in them. My T-shirt isn't too warm, but it's okay. I'm kind of wondering how I'm going to do this for 00 minutes straight. My thoughts kind of wander, but I'm not sure how I can record them for that long. I have a kind of upset feeling in my stomach right now. I think I'm just hungry. The rest of me is very relaxed because of the day I just spent out at LOCNAME LOCNAME, swimming and hiking. I loved the cold water that felt so good after the hot sun beating down on me in the car and during the hikes. The hikes were fun, though, because everything was so clean and clear, and it was fresh and refreshing. I wish my desk went back farther because I feel like the monitor is right in my face and it is too big for me to look at the whole thing. I would like a less-focused perspective on it, but I guess that's a dumb thing to say because it's nice to have a big monitor and it's not such a problem. People down the hall are getting kind of loud. It kind of annoys me when they talk really loud all over the dorm, but I guess it shouldn't because I could always just shut my door and it wouldn't be a problem. Plus, I know that I'm really loud a lot of the time, especially when friends come over and find my guitar, speaking of which, I need to get my guitar out of PROPNAME's trunk so I can practice it because they're so much better than me at playing and if we're going to do music for the Happening, I need to be better. I'm wondering if I'm doing this assignment right. I mean, am I supposed to record what I think and feel right now, or if my mind wanders to tangents should I record that too?  I guess I'll just go with my stream of consciousness, like the assignment says. My fingers are going to get tired of typing. I feel like they are getting worn smooth by my fingers always tapping on them. I guess the real problem is that my fingers are cold so there is a kind of loss of sensation and they don't move so well right now. My fingers always get so cold during the winter, especially. I'm kind of dreading fall for that reason, but I love fall and winter, and I'm actually really excited about it. I wonder if I was reading this if I would think I am a negative person. I mean, the whole thing is about negative stuff: cold toes and fingers and stomach pains and annoying stuff going on around. I'm actually a really happy person, I don't know why I complain so much. I wonder if I do that in everyday conversation, too. I guess I'm kind of whiny, but I catch myself doing it so I stop-plus, people know that I'm not really serious about it, I just like to make noise sometimes. rrOoooh, I like popping my knuckles-there I go trying to be positive-it's funny that that's what I came up with to be positive. I just did it, and it helps them feel so much more movable, which is ironic because it'll probably give me arthritis and keep me from moving them when I get old. Oh well, it's a habit I can't seem to break. On my desk I have pictures of my cousins. They are so cute-the little ones, the older ones are just goofy and funny. I love them. Just looking at them makes me laugh about dumb stuff that we've done. There is also a picture of my little sister making a really silly face into the camera. She's in her bathing suit, wearing goggles and everything. Everybody laughs at that picture, including me. There is also pictures of a church retreat I did called Happening. I love those pictures because that was probably the best week of my life and those people are probably my best friends in the world-except for my family because family has always known me and will always be there. I'm so glad that I'm saved. I used to never use that phrase bc I thought it was cheesy and overzealous, but it's so true. Where would my life be without PROPNAME?  I just don't know. He brings me so much joy that it's overwhelming. I wish I could share that with everyone who has never felt it, but some people don't want to hear it. that's too bad because I know people who need Christ (well, we all do, but I mean people who complain about a void in their life that they don't know how to fill) and they're the ones who I most want to tell about Him, but there is such an attitude in society that you just don't  \"preach\" to other people, and they would resent it if I tried to tell them. They don't realize that I just want to share-\"I know it can do it for you-you've got to know what it did for me. \" (song lyrics) but I'm labeled as one who judges-funny thing is that they're the ones who are judging me. My intentions are pure. It's not like I'm on commission-one extra year in Heaven for every person you bring to Christ-I just care about people and the Lord, and I want to serve Him and help them. It's the truth, you know?  If only I could just tap my experience into people so they wouldn't doubt me or think I'm false or that I'm just trying to glorify myself because I'm not. \"What do I care about pleasing men?  If I wanted to please men, I would not be a servant of God. \" Gal 0:00 That's PROPNAME's favorite verse. Hmmm, I wonder if PROPNAME is back in town yet. He went home for his dad's birthday this weekend. I should call him tonight, and now my 00 minutes are up so I can do that!  wow, that went fast. it's kind of scary how fast that went! \nAsnwer:"
