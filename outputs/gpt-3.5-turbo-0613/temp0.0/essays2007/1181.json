I love when people write me, and tell me what is going on in their life. It also makes me feel good when they ask me to do things with them. I really have a lot to do today. My bulletin board is just so plain. I have to get some color back up there, to make the room appear pretty. I love LOCNAME football, I need to put my poster back up of the football team and schedule. I love the picture my friend sent me in the mail, now I can look at it everyday on my magnetic board. I wonder if my roommate will come back after her class, so we can go eat lunch. I am really hungry. I wonder what they are having for lunch. I need to go check my mail, to see if I got a letter from the company I applied for work. I really hope I get that job, it would be so fun, and I would have some extra spending money. All of these wires on my desk are driving me up the wall. I need to see if I can hide them some way. I need to hook my printer up before I hide all of the wires. People come in and out of this dorm all day long. It is funny all the different schedules people have. I wonder if that screeching noise outside ended up in a wreck. Austin traffic really scares me. People just don't care when they are driving. I have to be the observant one, when I drive tonight. These pigeons outside my window are really getting on my nerves. I hate that purring noise they make. How do they even make that noise? They are such big and ugly birds. Somebody must be taking a shower, because the water is running in the bathroom. What could be making that squeaky noise I hear, it is about every minute. Dorms have all kind of noises. I really like my dorm now, I just need to finish decorating it, since I had to take it down for the sprinkler installation. I worked so hard getting my bulletin board perfect, then I had to rip it down. Now I have the task of putting it all back up, like I had it. I can't wait until I have it back like I had it because the room was just so bright and vibrant, with posters and fabric. I wonder if my theatre teacher will discuss that play we went to see last night. I can't believe he went to the same one. I think it was a little too different for me. I am not really into plays that much, so can I grasp the plot of this one, in order to write a critique? I bet he will say something about it today in class. I can not wait to hear what he has to say. I love that class, it is so much fun. He is so energetic, I look forward to it each day I get to go. I wonder if I will see PROPNAME today. I hope I get to talk to her, she is a nice person. I am getting kind of worried about my roommate, she is not back yet. I really want to go to lunch. I wish the sprinkler installation would be over, because I can't take much more of this drilling. I don't understand why it sounds so close, I thought they were finished with the rooms around us. Maybe these walls are just really thin. I like wearing a hat, I think I will do it more often. I didn't have to fix my hair, it was great. The bells are chiming, I love that sound. Look it is over time to stop. I wonder if I am supposed to end this in a specific way. Oh well, I don't know what to do. This was interesting. \nAsnwer:"
