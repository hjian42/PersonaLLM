    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: wanna see the real you- I love this song. by the suicide machines. I saw them last spring break with the descendents. good show. now green world is on. this is weird, trying to write continuously for 00 minutes. you tend to think  differently when you're forced to. like today, those questionnaires in psych class. I think I analyzed them too much and tricked myself into answering  differently. oh well. I have a lot of shit I need to be doing like returning that journalism book and buying the packet for that class. that class sucks. how  can journalists shove a camera and microphone in someone\u2019s face when they\u2019re in mourning or whatever. and those guys who caused the princess Di's wreck just for some pictures. it makes me sick. do they have no feelings or sympathy  whatsoever? does anyone? how the hell am I going to find a job that I like that doesn\u2019t require making it to the top, no matter who you step on to get there. I guess all jobs are like that I\u2019m just not a competitive person at all. never was. I don\u2019t need to put other people down or be the best at everything in order to feel good or proud like tough guys. sure I\u2019m proud of what I can do but I could  never hurt another soul doing it. well the music\u2019s off now and its quiet here in  my castilian dorm room except for the fan. my boyfriend and my friends are  upstairs, probably watching t. v. I wonder if he wants to go to that less than  PROPNAME show tonight I want to. they\u2019re pretty good. my back hurts. I need to go  to a chiropractor cant believe this stuff going through my head. how boring. I do think about interesting things sometimes. a few nights ago my boyfriend (PROPNAME) and me and three other girls got into a huge (drunk) argument about  how the world would be different if women were in all power. then we starting  arguing, are gender differences biological or environmental? kevin thinks  they\u2019re environmental, and has a nerdy, stubborn, math/scientist guy and shows  very little emotions. marita and I said no, its about 00/00, because women are  born with these instincts that men will never know until they grow uteruses  and give birth. ok I have 0 more minutes to write. my hair feels weird. I cut  about a foot off 0 days ago. it was down to my waist now its to my chin. I feel  bald. I wonder if I should dye it again. last year it was purple. man I\u2019m doing  it again, rambling on about boring stupid shit. I wonder if everyone else  sounds as dumb as me, chatting away about stuff nobody really cares  about. for twenty minutes. all to make a good grade. why is so much emphasis  placed on grades I wonder. they don\u2019t measure your intelligence. some people  always do their homework and make good grades. that me. some people study and  study but still bomb tests. that\u2019s me too. tests suck. especially true false  questions. I analyze those too much until I confuse myself. kevin doesn\u2019t have to  study and aces every test. no fair. well looks like my time is up. if anyone  actually read this, sorry. fun job huh. I guess you\u2019ve read much weirder  stuff than this anyway. well adios. \nAsnwer:"
