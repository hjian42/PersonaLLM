No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Right now my mind is confused because I'm not sure what exactly I am suppose to be writing. I think the more I write, the more information flows into my mind. For example, write now I just thought about how sunburned I am, and I wonder if I am going to peal. I'm also thinking about what I'm going to do tonight. I'm so tired, but I don't want to miss a night out with my friends. Seeing how I'm at my home in PROPNAME, I feel that I should spend as much time as I can with the people I don't see everyday. It is my first time to come home from college and I'm begining to understand what say about it being so stressful. There is just so much to do and not nearly enough time to do it in. I constantly think of all the homework and reading I should be doing in all my spare moments, but it's just so hard to concentrate when there is so much to do. I just found out that tTexas won today. I'm mad I missed the game-I bet it was so exciting. I hope this whole thing doesn't sound too dumb, although I'm sure it does. I wonder what everyone else has written on this assignment. I'm not a very deep person, but I have a feeling that this class will help me learn some things about myself and what I DO think about. There is so much going on in my head that it's hard to pick out every single thought. Well, I just looked down and my time is up. hope this has been interesting to read!!  \nAsnwer:"
