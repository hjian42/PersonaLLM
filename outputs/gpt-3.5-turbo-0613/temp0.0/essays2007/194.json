No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well it's hard to pinpoint my first thought as I begin to write, as it would be hard to pinpoint one thought that I have at any one time. I think constantly, usually about things that I should or shouldn't be doing at that time. For example, I constantly think about things I should be doing to help myself apply for medical school, like joining organizations, volunteering at hospitals, or studying to have that 0. 0 or higher. It seems like I'm always on the go now. This summer was pretty leisurely ORGNAME then I move down here and I try to work the same hours taking 00 hours instead of 0. It's not the best thing for the soul. Speaking of soul, I try to go to church when I can and I feel guilty when I don't, but I haven't found the chance to go yet. And I hate making excuses, but I do a lot. I just watched a TV show on ORGNAME called LOCNAME LOCNAME or something like that. It really excited me because I'm from a really small town, which  I don't think ever makes the news. I have been really impressed with ORGNAME and ORGNAME so far. All my professors have been great and I can learn from their lectures. I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME for two years, where I had to learn most things on my own. I transferred with Express and it is a lot harder down here. The manager is a lot stricter; I can't lean!  I'm going to cut my hair off this Friday, but I don't know if I should. But, on the other hand, my hair causes me to get really hot and sweaty. I have already made the appointment, so I guess I will go through with it. I can't imagine how boring this must be for y\u2019all to read,  but I guess it could get pretty interesting depending on the students  I guess you can tell how confused I am all the time. It shows in my writing how often my thoughts conflict one right after the other. Writing this hasn't taught me that though, I already knew I was confused. \nAsnwer:"
