I wrote this once before and my computer crashed it is no longer working and I was bout to pick it up and throw it out the window. This means that I really need a laptop or any new computer. I really want a laptop. Actually I would be content with a computer that will not shut down, freeze up and otherwise suck every 00 minutes. I am happy to be at ut this year. I am glad that I get to be near my girlfriend, we lived 0 hours apart last year, and its nice to see her everyday. I am on her computer right now, and it's too early to be doing this. I can't function. The past 0 days I was working my ass off to get this paper written for my freshman seminar and I got like 0 hours of sleep in those 0 days. That would have been fine if I got 0 each day, but I got one hour the first night, and five the next. Five isn't enough to overcome 0, and then last night after my extreme frustration with my computer not cooperating I went to sleep around 0:00 and then woke up at 0. That's still not enough. I need to get like 00 hours of sleep tonight; I would feel so much better. Well I am getting really bored doing this but I am keeping to the instructions, which for some unknown reason, were repeated over 00 times on the website. I mean I get the idea, I write what I think. You do not need to tell it to me, changing the order of the subject/object 00 times. Believe it or not saying the same thing, using the same words, but in a different order is not the same thing as explaining squat. I'm no expert, nor am I writer really. Actually my writing stinks. But I guess I expected more. College is a lot different from high school, but it certainly has its similarities. For example, my professor in my calc class is a really nice guy, but speaks very little English and has a heavy accent. Kids try and run over him, and it pisses me off. There enough problems with understanding him without him having to deal with people who refuse to listen to him. He knows his math and all. But still Anyway I am bored doing assignment, especially because I have don't it once before. OK I'm about to pass out. Someone needs to wake me up or something. Why can't I stay awake? Oh well im. I am a very slow typist. I wish I could type faster. But I am now finished with the minimum of 00 minutes and I will proceed to turn this in. I guess I'm allowed to stop writing what I'm thinking but I can't do it. Bye. \nAsnwer:"
