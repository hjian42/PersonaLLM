No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: At his time I am at the lab listening to everyone in here typing and some coughing as well. The laser printer doesn't seem to stop printing. I am at the ORGNAME ORGNAME lab doing this assignment. I am wondering whether or not I will be going home, LOCNAME, next week on Friday. I am hoping my friend will take me. I also hope I can bring back my sister, who is presently in LOCNAME, so that she can live with us. That way I don't have to worry about cooking or getting food for dinner. I am glad my Pre Calculus professor gave me permission to take my midterm on Monday, the day after I get back from LOCNAME--If I go. I just looked at the proctors. They are helping some people out with their passwords. I wish I could get a job as a proctor. I think that would be an easy way of getting some money. Most of them don't even know what they are doing. I just thought about my major. I hope I can get into the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in Advertising. That would be really neat since I like to do stuff like that. I just read that a lot of students in advertising have earned awards. But I just looked at some of their work and I don't think it would be all that hard to do. I just looked at my watch, I have about fifteen more minutes before I can send this message. A lot of people are leaving the lab know. That stinks, I wish their was a better computer when I got here. Right now I'm stuck with this old ORGNAME comp. --the only one in the lab that's still using Windows 0. 00. I wish I was home with my family right now. Especially since they left for LOCNAME today. If only I didn't have school right now, then I could live at home and help my dad with our family business. A lot of these computers in here are down. It sure would help if someone would fix them. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME--so that's who this building is named after. Who is he?  I've never heard of him. The sign on the wall says, \"Lumberman, Banker, Publisher, Statesman. \"  What does that have to do with Communications(except \"Publisher\"). I still have to do my rough draft for English. Oh well, I will probably do it tonight when I get home. Not like I can get any work done their. My brother is too loud and annoying. He doesn't let me study in peace. He is pretty stubborn--likes to have everything his way. Just because my parents aren't here, he thinks he's my guardian or something. I wish I lived in a dorm instead. That would have been cool. That way I could have met new people and friends. Not only that, it's right there on campus and they have cafeterias. That would help a lot. Now I only have six minutes to go. This thing is taking a pretty long time. If it weren't for this assignment I could have been working on my English paper right now. I hope that paper turns out good. At least my professor liked my proposal-he said I did an \"excellent job. \" In class he was saying how rare that case would be. Hopefully, I'll do well in this class. I really don't like English classes. Their so boring. All you do is discuss a lot of things, write papers, and practice grammar. I thought my English class would be very large, instead it ends up having only 00 people. I hate small classes. At least all my other classes have over one hundred people. Well, I'm done. I guess I will send now. \nAsnwer:"
