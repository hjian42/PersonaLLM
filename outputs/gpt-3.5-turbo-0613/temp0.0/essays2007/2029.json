No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well, I'm thinking that 00 minutes seem like an eternity when you don't have a topic to write about. I'm thinking about how awkward it is to be in the computer lab writing about absolutely nothing. Now, I'm thinking about what would the reader\" thing about my grammar. In my defense I'm not a native English speaker. Now I'm focusing on the girl right next to me. She lives in my dorm, and I'll probably never speak to her or get to now her because she is quiet and not my taste physically. I feel bored already and it's only been 0 minutes. I'm thinking what on earth will I write about for the next 00 minutes and a half now. Man, I'm a slow typist. It took me like 00 seconds to finish the last two sentences. Now I'm thinking about what will I do tonight. I wonder If I should go watch \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\". I really want to see it tonight, but the people that I'm going with are not nice people in my opinion. They'll probably be loud and make STUPID comments as the movie is playing. God, I find people like that annoying, but I don't have a car and I really want to see that movie. What the heck I'll do it! God, 00 more minutes! Pass is passing so slowly! I feel bored, and I'm wondering about the purpose of this writing assignment. Is someone really going to go through this boring stuff. I'm thinking I should spice it up, make it worth the torture the poor TA is going to go thru reading through all the writings. I feel I'm not creative enough to come up with some weird thought that is interesting, yet not crazy enough I'll be summoned by PROPNAME for some counseling. I feel extremely bored now. It sees like nothing is going on in my head. I feel nothing, besides bored, and great expectation for this to end. Now I feel aroused, a hot girl just entered the room. I'm thinking she must be one of those weird girls cause she is dressed in short-short pants and is wearing catholic school girl socks and shoes. I'm thinking I don't care if she is crazy no more. she is hot. Now I'm wondering if the reader is going to be some girl. She is going to think I'm a pig hahahah. The girl is gone. I'm noticing how everyone that was pretending not notice her started acting differently and more relaxed as soon as she left. I feel better now, cause I've only got 0 and half minutes to go. I'm feeling nothing, thinking nothing. I'm just focusing on the clock. I think this has been officially the longest minute ever. I'm do \nAsnwer:"
