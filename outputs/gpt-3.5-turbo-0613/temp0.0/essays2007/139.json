No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I finally got all of my Ethernet problems worked out today, so I e-mailed  everyone I know. I wish my mom would call so I could tell her that not only  did I get the package with my Windows 00 disk but I also received my PROPNAME  care package. It had all kinds of goodies in it but I haven't yet gotten to eat  any of them yet. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I haven't heard from him since Monday I think. He's probably at work, or playing Magic with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I'm glad  I got a card from PROPNAME today, looks like she's having a good time at ORGNAME. Maybe  I'll call her before I go to the Red River Shoot-Out in LOCNAME, or better yet maybe she's got a place to stay in LOCNAME and I could stay with her. I wish the guys  working outside would be quiet. And for once the girls in my hall are quiet, either that or they aren't there. My fingers are really cold , but they aren't numb yet so I guess I'll live. I'm so excited! I get to  go to my first UT football game on Saturday. But I also get to go to all of the other home football games because I got Season tickets. maybe I'll see my Aggie friends at the ORGNAME game November, PROPNAME doesn't have an e-mail address yet otherwise I\u2019d write her. I  don't think I get to go home again until September the twentieth, but maybe I'll get to see PROPNAME then, unless he comes here, but I don't think that he'll do that because it will end up costing him to much money, then again it will cost me a lot of money too, if I keep going back and forth I hope that I\u2019m getting enough sleep to make it all the way through the day. I need to start planning my week like I  learned how at the time Management and Study Strategies Seminar I went to on Sunday I think I need to take a nap. I wish I had some nail polish remover, I need to repaint my toenails. I wonder if I can make it through three weeks before I need to get my nails redone. I hope so I don\u2019t want to change manicurists, I like PROPNAME. \nAsnwer:"
