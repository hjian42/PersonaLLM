    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am downloading stuff on kazaa. I've saved so much money this way. I need to make sure my grammar, punctuation, and spelling are correct. I have a basketball (plush) on my table, although I never play with it. Yeah, my web cam sucks. It's old. But free. My roommate is cool. He is sitting there doing the survey. I had a good day today. I want to go to the church next to PROPNAME. Probably this sunday. Yeah. Sunday sounds good. 0000 is my room number. I have a song stuck in my head right now. I can't remember the name of it. actually, I didn't know the name to begin with. Its a rap song. I need to charge my Palm m000. And take a shower. That would feel good. My mouth is dry. I need something to drink. Now I need to piss. It's really dark in here. This apple juice is not good for my teeth. I think there's sugar in it. Not good. Wow, it's only been 0 minutes and 00 seconds. That sucks. I'm getting bored. I want to play some computer games. Too bad I'm stuck with this assignment. Oh, now I have a different rap song stuck in my head. I think I'm obsessed with them. I remember listening to this song a few hours ago before dinner. I was at my friends house if I can remember correctly. Humans are funny. I need to spend my taco bell coupon. Coupon or Coupon? I've heard it pronounced both ways. I wonder when my parents are going to call? Probably soon after 0? Or maybe 0:00? Haha, I just remembered something from dinner. My friend was taking pictures of girls with his phone camera. The asterisk looks like a snowflake. I noticed that I like to stand my chair up on it's front two legs. Well, that is if it had legs. It's more like a bar on both sides and connected in the middle. At least its comfortable, unlike the ones in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Yeah. LOCNAME LOCNAME. I went on a field trip there. No, wait. It was LOCNAME on the LOCNAME. Maybe that is close. I don't know. I like the way you do it right thar. A line from the song I have stuck in my head. Geez, its been 0:00 only. Like I said earlier, this sucks. Damn, I'm typing too fast and my grammar is messing up. My speaker system and subwoofer rock. My hands hurt from typing so much. I should study more. I haven't even opened any of my books yet. Oh well, the weekend is coming up. I can do most of my stuff then. I hope I'm not going to be like this later on in the year. It's a bad sign. I hope I don't get lost in my homework assignments. I can't seem to find the Philosophy 000 website. Not good. Yeah. I got a nice view from here. I need to email my parents and send them more pictures. Awww, how sweet of me. I never realized how long 00 minutes can be. Wow. It's like. long. Yeah, anyways, I feel kind of weird talking to myself. Weird? Or is it spelled wIErd? I will have to look that up later. I'm sore from sitting like this. Well, I only have 0 more items on my download list in ORGNAME Lite K++. If you read this, get the K++ edition, not Kazaa, not Diet Kazaa, and not Kazaa Lite. K++ &gt; *. Yuuuhhhhhhhhh. I'm bored. I need to shower. I already mentioned that didn't I? Awesome, only 0 0/0 minutes to go. This sucks. It's boring. I'm not thinking of anything. My neck hurts. I don't smell anything out of the ordinary. I guess I got used to the smell of my room. 0 more minutes! I don't think I can last that long. I don't want to go to prison. Heh, it's not a confession or hinting at anything I've ever done. I'm a good guy. Yeah. Good. Maybe too good. Nah. 0 0/0 minutes to go. Wow, I'm really slowing down. This would probably take up 0 to 0 pages in ORGNAME Word, 00 point font, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. It's kind of sad how I can know this. I will test it out whenever I finish the 00 minutes. I also need to test out w(ei/ie)rd. SAT format baby. Yeahhhhh! 00 seconds! I think I will just wait it out. I'm so happy now. YAY! \nAsnwer:"
