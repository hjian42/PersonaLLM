I never thought I would feel so home sick at college. I love my mother so much she has been through hell and back and still remains such a wonderful Christian mother. If I am half the mother she is to me when I have children I know I will be doing a great job. I am also really nervous about this presentation I have to do on Monday for my Media Studies class. Not only do I not know what to write about but I don't know how to prepare for it. Of course I got there late for my discussion group  so I got the bottom of the barrell when signing up for a presentation topic and the only one left was for Monday. But that is so my luck. It makes me think that if I am nervous about giving this in front of my discussion group of maybe twenty people how am I going to make it in the communications field which is what I am majoring in at this point. I really want to work for ORGNAME. I know many people must think of this as a childish fantasy, but it is really something I am serious about and want to persue. I just love everything about music. The artists there story, the songs story, and how they make people fell. I can't wait till I am done typing this because then I get to go play PROPNAME with my roomate and a couple of our friends from back home. I am such a competitive person which to me is a good thing because it makes me have more determination then most people. I am watching Will and Grace and they are talking about having a baby. Gosh I can't wait till that day. I think I must have orange cones around me though and a flashing message that tells guys don't talk to her!  I swear they avoid me at all costs. What the heck is wrong with me. I think I might be a little intimidating because I don't play the role of a dumb girl who needs a guy to take care of her. Which I think I got that from my mother. She is a single mom, my father died when I was ten, who is a teacher and had to raise three children all by herself. She didn't need help from anyone and she never threw in the towel when times got hard. For that I respect and love her very much. God has blessed me with the best family I could have ever imaged. Not only my imidate family but everyone from my grandparents to aunts and uncles to cousins. All of them have played such an important part of my life and have thought me so much that I just want to go and hug all of them and say thanks for loving me it has given such strength. My grandparents are so great because they can always make me feel like a million bucks even when I am at my lowest. I think it is important to surround yourself with a close knit family. I don't know what I would do without mine. I am so glad I have my roomate and friends from back home here at LOCNAME. I probably won't have latest this long without them and there company. They all have such interesting stories that I had never know about them before. Most of my school went to LOCNAME a and m which is exactly like my hometown. We all just needed something different and a place with a good sports team \nAsnwer:"
