No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: This is a really strange writing assignment. it's hard to write to keep up with your thought s. the U. s open is on tv right now, PROPNAME PROPNAME is playing PROPNAME PROPNAME. I'm not really sure who is winning but they look like pretty even competitores. PROPNAME is eighteen and she is really improving while PROPNAME is getting older now and she isn't as good as she use to be. It's really hard to make myself do all of the work for colloege. There is really a lot of reading and I'm having trouble deeping up. My mythology class has a lot of reading and its pretty boring so I end up putting it off. I really just do the work that I know I'm going to get quizzed over soon like in Calculus and Eco. Calculus is eadsy though because last year I learned al ot in Mr. PROPNAME's class and the new teacher is just explaining the same old stuff. Psy is really interesting in class but I haven't read much for it because I took Psy last year in high school and we used the same book. So hopefully that will help me make good grades in it this year. I have so much reading to do for muythologe because we have a quiz on tuesday and it is going to be so hard because the teacher thinks that it is so interesting an that we remember like everything she says or assighns. The horse sale this weekend is going to be really fun. I hope we find another one like eden that will only sell for her broodmare value. I hope PROPNAME agrees to take PROPNAME and PROPNAME n I've. But if he doesn't then I guess that PROPNAME will and he is a good trainer. It is so annoying that ORGNAME ORGNAME's Jockey didn't listen to us in the race. He should have held her back at the beginning but he had to try to be a hotshot. She should have won. Oh well, she is only two now, I hope she has a lot more races ahead of her. She could be really good once she gets sorted out. I can't beleive that PROPNAME's foal has such bad back legs. It seems to happen  every time when we breed to an outside stallion. I hope PROPNAME isn't too mad that I blew our meeting off today. But I just really wasn't in the mood to hassle with all the traffic and everything, besides, I didn't even understand the directions to the place. Oh yes!!! its already been twenty minutes. \nAsnwer:"
