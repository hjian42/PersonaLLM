I think this has got to be one of the easiest grades I have ever made. I am feeling a bit like PROPNAME PROPNAME (at the end of each episode, it is night and he normally sits at his computer and types his journals out and reflects upon the events that happened throughout the day). I am typing this in ORGNAME word, because it was recommended by your little site and was repeated about 0 times. Although I have Physics tomorrow, which I have no clue what is going on in because my teacher is a bit confused himself. I am feeling relieved because I had this HUGE paper due in my freshman seminar class today and I worked my ass off for it and I feel good about it. I am not all that great of a writer but I think I will get a decent grade on it. Plus it was only a first draft, and we will have to go back and revise them and whatnot. By the time I am completely finished with the paper I am going to despise it but hey, that is how it goes, I suppose. I think it is good for a person to just sit and write or type every once and a while. I have a friend, PROPNAME, who has gone through like 00 journals in the past 0 years. She tries to find time for it everyday. it is her relaxation and when she is really upset or depressed, once she gets everything out. she feels better. Which reminds me, I need to give her a call. I miss her. She goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I am actually sitting on the phone with my boyfriend who is also in the class (PROPNAME PROPNAME). We are both typing this writing assignment at the same time. Well. I thought it was a bit humorous. I am actually in a really good mood, because my boyfriend and I actually live in the same city now. It is a really good feeling. We met last year, here in LOCNAME at debate camp. He is from LOCNAME (LOCNAME LOCNAME), so we spent just under a year living 0 hours apart from each other. All of my classes are going pretty good, although I still don't really have a clue what I want to major in just yet. I am in the college of Liberal Arts (woo hoo!) and I was thinking about a double major in psychology and government. I also want to go to law school. I seriously doubt I will get into ORGNAME's law school. It is way too competitive. * Sigh * who knows, I sure don't. I am living at PROPNAME right now, and let me tell youI am getting ripped off. It is $0000 a year and I have a little room and have to walked up stairs all the time because I live on the 0nd floor (the \"intensive study floor\"), which I never signed up to be in. I guess it isn't all that bad though; at least I'm not at Jester. I don't have a car here because my parents are irrational. I have a car sitting in the garage at home but they didn't want me to bring it with me because they thought it would be some sort of a \"growing experience\" for me. Although I only live around an hour or so away from here (LOCNAME, LOCNAME. near LOCNAME LOCNAME) I haven't been home since I have been here. I have no real desire to go home. I hated high school, well I hated it my senior year. All my friends graduated and my classes were a waste of time. I guess that is one of the reasons why I feel I can't compete with some of the people here at LOCNAME, my high school didn't have much to offer. I have a good friend of mine (PROPNAME) that came and saw me the weekend before last. She is at ORGNAME and she hates it there. Although I miss her, I think she misses me a whole hell of a lot more. She has resorted to hanging out with people from our high school that didn't give her the time of day for the last 0 years of her life. Jocks and whatnot. Supposedly there is this annoying kid (who I started to resent in high schoolPROPNAME Hall) that talks to her nonstop about me. Scott and I were buds back in 0th grade and once we got to high school, I no longer existed. That happened with a lot of my jr. high friends. Back to PROPNAME, well she told me yesterday that she has \"found God. \" If only you knew PROPNAME, you would know that is a load of shit. If she is happy, then hey I am all for it, but I don't think it is something she'll stick with. I am not an atheist or anything but I just don't know and don't care to find out. I am not saying I won't be open to opinions and respectful of one's commitment and dedication but it is something that annoys me. I guess that is because of my parents. They use to force me to go to church, and my dad wouldn't let me go out or do anything on Sundays unless I went (even though he would sit at home, watching football or somethinghypocrite!) Alright. I have far surpassed the 00minute limit and I'm out. \nAsnwer:"
