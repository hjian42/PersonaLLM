She read my essay today, and she couldn't understand a word on it. My topic is on samesex marriage, but she didn't even know that samesex marriages are illegal in the U. S. She read through the whole thing and asked me, \"So what is your point?\" At first, I thought it was just me, so I took it to the writing center. In a way, I just wanted to talk to someone. I had to complain about her to someone. Anyways, the guy in the writing center agreed with me. It's not my problem that she can't read. Well, I guess it is since she is the one who's going to grade my paper, but I am not going to put up with her. I am so going to change my teacher tomorrow. I am so glad that I still have the chance. I feel really relieved because my rough draft is done. I finally feel like I am getting somewhere with my paper. I am also very excited because the weekend is coming up. I am going to finish my homework in one day and enjoy the rest of my weekend. Maybe I will do my homework for the next week ahead of time so I will have more time during the week. I don't know. I seem to be addicted to homework lately. My dad said that I won't be happy if I move out. Well, I don't think that is true at all. I admit that college life is much harder than I have ever imagined, but living with him doesn't change that a bit. It's not like he could help me with my homework. He never did anyway. I feel so relieved after I moved out. It's great that I only have to deal with school. Dealing with my dad is much harder than anything else. I haven't really talked to my mom for a week now. I don't really know if I should call her. She is so worried about me. In a way, she is giving me a lot of stress. We are always talking about the same thing now. She keeps trying to convince me to move back. There is just no way that I am going do it. \nAsnwer:"
