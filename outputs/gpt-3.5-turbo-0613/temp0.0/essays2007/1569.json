By now I had figured that I would have at least made some new friends, and I have. I mean, ORGNAME in my Theory and piano classes is totally awesome and in the cello studio I am in I have met some awesome people and made some friends like PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME but I vowed that I would not get stuck in the music building all day long and only hang out with music people. Okay, so I'm a music major and of course those are the people that I am mostly going to be hanging out with but music is a very isolated world. When I go to my other classes its like a whole nother world out there. I really did like that song from LOCNAME, and that was a great ORGNAME movie. I haven't seen any of the more recent ones but that's to be expected right? But hey, a vicarious Disney movie is good every now and then. I love Sleeping Beauty. I think almost every girl dreams about a wonderful guy, her one true prince that will come and sweep her off her feet and take her from, well maybe not take her from her world, because I actually like my world right now. No, I'm not happy with everything in it, especially my social life, but that can be fixed. Ack!! I have no idea how I am going to make it to Astronomy on time. I have had more panic attacks in the past two weeks about Astronomy than I have had in the past year. I have to get from the music building to PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I know that its not IMPOSSIBLE because I know like four people who are doing it, but. shit, I'm not a small person, I wasn't a track star in high school or in any sport as a matter of fact so I don't move as fast as others, and when I get stressed I start to have labored breathing, I have very bad allergies. The fastest I have been able to make it is in 00 minutes, and I have to cut it down to 00. What's the worst is that I hate being late anywhere. Its one of my pet peeves so being late to a class is major for me, besides the fact that I, well I actually don't interrupt class I just sit down on the steps in the back of the room and take notes on the lecture. I'm also kind of worried, not really worried but sort of about the class because almost everyone I have talked to has said that it is a hard class. But over the years I have noticed that I actually like the harder classes that challenge me. Maybe these first couple of weeks have been kind of a, I don't know,. I don't know what I'm thinking. I really do go back and delete typos, geez I can't even let a con't go by. oh well. My mom should be coming home soon. She helps out with the orchestra director at my high school, I'm from LOCNAME and am typing from home by the way, not like you really care. hmmmm. . but tonight's back to school night and thats a really big night for elementary, middle, and high schools. I didn't make the symphony last week. I didn't play my best audition so I shouldn't be suprised but I had really wanted to make it, but the University orchestra is playing some really awesome music this semester. We're playing Egmont by PROPNAME, a Mendhelson piano concerto, the Mother Goose Suite by PROPNAME, and Second Essay for Strings by PROPNAME. I played Adagio by PROPNAME in high school, oh, that was an amazing performance. If there were a lever that I could press that would make me feel like I do when I'm playing a truly amazing concert I would press that all the time. I hope that I will have the same feelings in college, its just that High School orchestra was so awesome and amazing with Mr. PROPNAME, he picked music that we could play and that was really good too. I mean come on, Overtures to Candide, the Merry Wives of LOCNAME, LOCNAME, and PROPNAME and PROPNAME just to name a few. And in ORGNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, we played the full, I mean the FULL COMPLETE the Planets by PROPNAME. People would ask me   oh, what movements?   and I would be like ALL OF THEM BABY!!! Oh!! and Scheherezade! that was a. . ahh!!! I can't even express how utterly amazing that concert was. Wow, I love music so much, but Music Theory is a pain in the ass. Not that it's all bad, alot of it is nice, but tedious. I just can't figure out and easy way for me to identify major and minor intervals. I can easinly identify perfect fifths and octaves but most people can. Well, techinically its easier for me because my instrument is tuned in fifths so each of my strings are a fifth apart and octaves, well, those are just the same note. My high school band friends love what they do so much. Its refreshing in a way to see them having the time of their life playing and having fun, doing what they love, and that is my goal too. I'm in music because I have fun doing it, recieve a joy unsurpassed doing it, and give a joy to others also. Hopefully I'm going to go se Le Mis next week. I haven't seen it yet, and I just really really really want to, but the tickets are expensive, heck any tickets are expensive now adays, but when weren't they?  So if my friends don't want the really expensive seats I am going with them. \nAsnwer:"
