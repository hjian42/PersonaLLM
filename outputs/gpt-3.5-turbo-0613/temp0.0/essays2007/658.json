No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I'm just wondering how everything is going to work out, I mean, how is my relationship going to work out if she's in LOCNAME and I'm in TExas. Well, I guess it shouldn't matter that much cause I should be thinking about school. Damn, this place gives me the creeps. No one that I can really talk to. How is anyone going to survive here. Gosh, I miss my baby. Am I making the right choices here in classes?  Am I making the right choices in my relationship?  I mean, if it doesn't work out, then what am I going to do?  My relationship . man, I'm confused. This place is big. This university is big. How am I going to stand out?  I haven't met any new friends, not very many. My room mate also sucks. I have no money. That's another thing, how am I going to survive financially?  How am I to get enough money to support my college tuition?  Mom and dad can't provide the whole thing and financial aid won't cover it all. How am I to make up the rest of the money?  And if I do get a job, how am I to balance my job and school at the same time. Gee, and how come I keep thinking of my girlfriend?  Damn, everything goes back to her. I can't believe the time I spend thinking of her. This is hopeless. I can't believe I'm even doing this relationship thing. Damn, my head hurts. I hope I'm doing this assignment right. If not, then I'm in trouble. what a way  to start out college. Man, I have a headache. I wonder if I'm dying. Ha, I wonder if I'm dying all the time. I wonder if I make myself sick by thinking about that so much?  I hope I don't get fat. I hope this college thing doesn't' make me fat and I hope that this whole college thing works out. I don't want to waste anymore of my parent's money. I don't even know what I'm doing here in college. I don't know what I want to be, what I want to do, or how the future's going to be like. Maybe I'm scaring myself. I think about this stuff too much when I should be out doing something about it. I feel so lazy and so useless. So insignificant. Is this what the real world going to be like?  Am I going to be another insignificant person?  Gosh, my head hurts. Everyone in this room looks dead. Everyone looks like they've been drained of their energy. Man, it's been only 00 minutes and I am writing a bunch of crap. Ha, I guess this is stream of conscience writing huh?  I guess it means to just talk to yourself. How come I don't see any familiar faces?  No one here is a familiar face to me. I thought I knew a lot of people but damn, I know no one. I hope things get better. I don't think I can stand much more of this. I want to go home for a while. Jester's food is getting old and I miss my parents. I just miss having nothing to do. Maybe I'm just lazy, I don't know. I can't keep thinking like this. I'm not lazy. Think positive buddy. Ha, I'm talking to myself again. I wonder what the professor's going to think about this paper?  Oh well, out of 000 some odd students in a class, I don't' think anyone's going to get to this paper. See what I mean?  InsignificantF!!!  Why so pessimistic PROPNAME?  Damn, what happened to the old you?  I guess things change huh?  I guess things are never going to be the same. Didn't you say you wanted to go to college to get away from it all?  Didn't you say that you wanted to start over?  HEre's your chance buddy. Take the risk. BE yourself. Meet people. Make yourself a significant part of something. Don't just dissapear. oh, times up. \nAsnwer:"
