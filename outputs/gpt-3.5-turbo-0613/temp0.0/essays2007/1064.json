I know I should not have gone out last night. I did anyway. I told myself that I could easily say \"no\" when asked to go out, but who was I kidding? I knew I would give in at some point. Anyway, I knew I would get sick because everyone else in my dorm has gotten sick. I knew my turn would have to come. I am very distressed right now. I have met so many people in the past ten days, and I cannot remember everyone's names. People tend to remember my name, though. It is easy to remember. PROPNAME. I would remember that too. That's my name, PROPNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME. Wow, I guess I do kind of like my name! I never can really decide if it's a good name or not, but I think it is ok. \"Ok,\" that's a very complex word; I just learned in my philosophy class about the term \"ok. \" I love my philosophy class; it's really interesting. I am about to go to my freshman seminar, which is entitled, \"Success With Less Stress. \" It's very interesting. I started reading the text yesterday, and it's awesome. It's seemed quite redundant at points, yet interesting overall. I love to write. I have been told that I am a very creative writer. I like that. I like being creative. I think it's interesting to be creative instead of always being precise and conservative. I forgot what I was about to say. I'm glad I can still type with a moderate speed. I would be screwed right now if I were a horrible typist. I am not all that great, but I am fairly quick. I love choosing words to write. I write differently than I speak, though. Sometimes I wish I were able to speak as creatively as I write. I have to admit, though, I do come up with some fun words. Fantabulous. I love that word. Absofuckinglutely. I love that one too. I only say that one on occasion, though. It sounds quite harsh coming from a girl. I try not to cuss a whole lot, but I can't help it sometimes. Like, when I'm around my girlfriends, I tend to cuss a whole lot more than when I'm around guys. I think girls sound trashy when they cuss constantly. I had NEVER said a cuss word in my whole life until I was about fourteen years old! Now, I've gotten a little too comfortable saying them. I even cuss when I'm around my mom, which doesn't make her too happy. She cusses on occasion around me too, though. Wow, I don't know what I'm doing. I met this guy named ORGNAME, and, I think he's a real cutie, but I've also met so many other people in the past weeks, and I like some of them, too. It's weird, thoughI was out last night at this Figi Pledge Line bullshit, and I met some real hotties, but I still thought about Cas; and, I even called him from the party. Weird, huh. I don't think he is the hottest guy, but he has the most awesome personality. I can't stand to talk to a guy, no matter how hot he is, if he doesn't know what to say to me. Cas is right on. He makes me smile and laugh all of the time. I like that. And, he likes me too. That's weird. I mean, not to be braggy, but I do get hit on quite a lot, but some guys obviously just don't like me once they get to know me, which is standard in most cases, but, Cas knows me. I am completely myself around him, and he still likes me. He told me he likes me. I told him that I am mad at myself for liking him  it was funny. I am straight forward with him. It's nice to be that way sometimesyou know, not hide anything. Some things I believe we, as humans with feelings and emotions, should not say  there are things we should keep to ourselves. I believe that we, as humans with feelings and emotions, should share most things. I just clearly contradicted myself, yet it makes since. I know most people think the same way. I am getting tired of typing. I feel drowsy, and my fucking head and throat hurt. I am going to work out anyway, though. I am addicted to working out. I love it and hate it at the same time. I usually dread actually getting up and going, yet I love sweating and the high I get from actually doing it. Ok, I have been writing the standard amount of time now, and I have another class in ten minutes. Bye. \nAsnwer:"
