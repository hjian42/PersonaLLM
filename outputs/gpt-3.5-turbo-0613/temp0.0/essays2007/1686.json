No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      so i don't know exactly what im supposed to write about here. i guess whatever is on my mind at the moment. my roomate is watching some wierd movie right now and the lady in it is screaming about something going wrong. and her husband is talking on the phone to another woman. maybe he's cheating on her with this other woman. who knows?  so it's 0:00 right now and I don't want to what else to write about. . i would really like to be listening to Dashboard Confessional right now. they are such an awesome band!  i really am getting into them lately!  PROPNAME has got such an amazing voice. . plus he's gorgeous!  i went and saw LOCNAME last month. that was a great show!  i want to see them agian. tehy need to come to LOCNAME soon. they would have a great turnout if they did!  last night i went to a concert. . it was at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, LOCNAME, and Cave-in all played. . PROPNAME was amazing!  ORGNAME was a lot better yesterday than the last time that I was them with Dashboard and PROPNAME!  I actually kind of liked their music!  And then Cave-in was alrigth too. I had fun watching the drummer's ab and arm muscles move around and work as he played bis drums with his shirt off!  it was nice!  why is it that all drummers play with their shirts off?  i guess they just like to be topless. and have all the girls stare at them. or maybe it's just a sweat thing as PROPNAME says. who really knows?  PROPNAME is a cool girl. im glad that i met her at orientation. . i have soo much fun hanging out with her. . but chris is great!  he is soo funny!  and hes so sweet too!  i hope he gets my email about wanting to be study buddies with him for french class. . . that would be a great help!  plus you know i'd be able to see chris more often. . wahoo!  he is soo adorable. but really. i do need the help in french. thats one of those classes that you really have to work hard at every single day in order to get good at and stay good at. . he seems to be doing pretty well in there. especially since he took french longer than i did. maybe a year more. but who really cares. he is better at it than i am. or so i think. i hope he wants a study buddy too for that class. because i really want to do better on my next test in there. i want to pul my grade up from a b to an a, which i won't be able to do unless i get help from someone else. and chris would be the perfect person to get that help from. anyway. im getting tired of typing everyhting that comes into my mind. . . but i guess thats exactly what everyones blogs are about. just them randomly typing waht they are thinking about and sharing it with everyone!!!  john sur is good at that. he always has something interesting or intellectual or funny to say in there. . its great!  i am soo glad that we became friends. he really does seem to make me feel smarter just because he teaches me so much!  especially and my faith. . he really has influenced me and helped me out so much with that. . i don't know what i would have done without him. his everlasting questions and curiosity have made me wonder and become more curious myself about my own faith and i thank him for that. also for him and holly inviting me to the bible study back home!  that really helped me out tremendously!  i don't know what i would have done without that group of people. some of them have become my best friends this past year and i don't know how my life would be different without them!!  they really do make me feel like a better person for knowing them. . and i thank them from the bottom of my heart for them always being there for me with all of the neverending support!  i miss all of them soo much here at college. but at least i ahve a few of them here at LOCNAME. John and PROPNAME are here. and I'm glad about it!  they really make me feel more at home here even though i may not see them all the time. . they are such great friends!!!!  oh and my fig!  its amazing!  im soo glad that i signed up for it. . it truly does help you feel more at home here in school and make LOCNAME feel like a smaller campus. because i really don't think that it seems like it is as big as everyone says it is. i mean. i see people i know everywhere. . . wheter they are in my fig. i went to high school with them. . middle school. orientation. camp texas. or i just know them from something else. i see poeple that i know everywhere and I'm glad of it it sooo nice to be able to that! \nAsnwer:"
