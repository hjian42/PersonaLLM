I have been going none stop on about four hours of sleep. Chemistry 000, I have found, is really kicking my butt. I made a seventy on the quiz, but I think I could have done a lot better. Tonight I'm going to go see Shrek 0 with PROPNAME and the guys. I can't remember if it is any good or not, but I guess I'm going as an excuse not to do my homework. One day I will get around to reading chapter three in psychology. This weekend I'm taking PROPNAME to LOCNAME to go see PROPNAME and PROPNAME for PROPNAME's birthday party. LOCNAME LOCNAME is such a far drive from here. I think that it will take me about seven hours to get there but then I have to drive another thirty or so minutes to PROPNAME for the actual party. I'm going to meet Mom Sunday afternoon on the way home for a nice home cooked meal. I haven't had one of those for so long. Well, actually PROPNAME's mother cooked us fajitas and lasagne last weekend when we went to LOCNAME, but that is not the same as my mom's cooking. After the ORGNAME vs. UT game on Saturday, which might I add we kicked their butt, about eight of us loaded up and decided to go to LOCNAME spur of the moment. PROPNAME's parents have a house in LOCNAME. His dad works for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME as an athletic director. Hmmm. I am running out of things to talk about now. October 0th, is the Aubrey homecoming football game and my friend PROPNAME has to crown this year's queen so I'm going home for the weekend to see everyone. I miss everyone a lot but I don't as much as I thought that I would. High school was great but college is so much better. Although, I would have to say that even though I was the valedictorian and I didn't have to study that much in high school, college is so much more difficult. I think I'll probably change my major a few times too. I know for sure that I want to do something in the medical field with children but I have no idea what I want to major in before I get there. And would my phone quit freaking beeping at me so I can finish this assignment!  Ok its just PROPNAME wanting to know if I am going to watch Shrek 0 at Jester tonight at 0. I wish that I could have went to party on the plaza today but I had so much to do it was nearly impossible. I had a TIP mentor meeting at 0, which is when my last class ended but I had to cut that an hour in a half short to go to a TIP seminar that was about notetaking. Now how boring is taking notes about notetaking. That is almost as bad as the seminar I have to go to three times a week. Critical thinking is thinking about thinking. YUCK!  Couldn't the writers of the book think of something just a little more creative than that. I mean who wants to sit in lecture first thing in the morning and listen to a speech about what it means to be a critical thinker. Anyways, then I left the notetaking seminar early to go to Women in Medicine. The speaker there talked about how she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired. I couldn't imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see. I have 00/00 vision right now but that doesn't mean that I'm a good driver. I have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks. Two weeks ago I went to LOCNAME to go see my friends in a band and I ended up staying in LOCNAME until 0 in the morning. When I was coming home the next day I stopped and got coffee before I headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later I dozed off. I had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile. I can't believe I keep doing that. It is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree. My Dad called this weekend, which is odd considering he just decided to flee last Christmas and not tell anyone where he was going. He said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure I was ok. I'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream. The reason why I wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird. If he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too?  Maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future. . just kidding. Ok well here is the countdown. I only have about 00 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me. Ok my time should be about up now. Yeah ok I'm done. . The End! \nAsnwer:"
