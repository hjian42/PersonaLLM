I sort of wish I would have gone to school with my best friend PROPNAME. I had too much fun this summer and now I'm just really bored with ORGNAME. Even so my classes seem interesting enough. I'm glad I switched majors. My family got a puppy. I told them they should name it PROPNAME, but I think that that would make my Aggie sister not to happy. I can't wait for my friends to visit me in October. Real stupid, huh. I'm all looking forward to two months from now. I feel kind of bad though, because I think Troy likes me too much and I'm just not interested. I really hope PROPNAME doesn't get mad at me if I hurt his feelings. Like she is one to judge. I'm really looking forward to going jetskiing, but I really want to go dancing. I can't wait to go to clubbing. I hope PROPNAME calls me today. She's being a real butthead. Well I guess I understand. We're all having money troubles. I hope I find a job. It's really going to suck if I don't. I'm sort of wondering if someone is going to read this. I really hope not cause I think I sound kind of stupid. I am sort of stupid, but that doesn't mean everyone should know. I hope PROPNAME writes to me soon. I'm going to feel really dorky if I write to him and he never writes back. Bambino. I think I'm going to play a trick on PROPNAME today. He is such a jerk. I cannot believe that he was so rude to me last year. I really expected a lot more from him. I sort of miss our friendship, but I guess that's how it goes. I really miss PROPNAME. I wish it hadn't ended the way it did. I feel like crying now. How is it that you can ever forget someone that you loved so much. It's like he's dead to me now, cause I can never talk to him again. Oh well. I know I would hate it if we got back together. I feel like I'm writing in a diary, but I can't say the really juicy stuff. I want to go to Six Flags. I love amusement park rides. I wish PROPNAME had gotten on the rides with me the last time. It was so funny to see her so terrified. I miss PROPNAME. I should write her a note today. I hope she still has email. I'm really going to miss her if I can't find her. PROPNAME is one of the greatest people I know. She is so nonjudgmental. I wish I could see her again. I have to stop procrastinating. I don't know what else to write . . OK  I hope PROPNAME comes to pick me up soon. I would really like to see her. I am so pathetic. Here it's only been a week and a half and I'm already wanting to see my friends again. I was going to write something, but I forgot. Damn it I hate it when that happens. I hope I make some more friends this year. People who like to do stuff, like PROPNAME. I can't believe she actually took me to LOCNAME whenever I wanted to go. It's to bad they grounded her at the end of the summer. THAT' ALL FOLKS! \nAsnwer:"
