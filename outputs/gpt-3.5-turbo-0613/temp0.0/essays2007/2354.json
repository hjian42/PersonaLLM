However, I am working on it instead of studying for some other assignments given by other professors. I am so behind right now. I didn't even read a page of psy yet. Why? It is all because my sis's bf lost his carkey!!! I left the book in his car on Friday. And the result of this? I have to wait till Monday 0AM. That's when he got his spare key from LOCNAME! My room is so not-neat right now. I need more time! I went to my sister's friend's apartment just now. His place is so messy. I guess the place that I live in is not bad at all. The psy class is so huge. I am in TIP classes. Most of the classes are not in the big auditorium. I am excited about being a college students. I met a lot of new people. People from different cities. There is a badminton club in ORGNAME ORGNAME. I am joining it for sure. I love playing badminton. However, in my high school, we only played badminton during PE for a week or so. I wonder why people here don't like badminton that much. Bio is so interesting. I like chemistry too. However, there are some serious reading that need to be done at home. On top of all those, there are in-class quizzes and discussion that I have to attend. Where can I find all the time to do all the thing that need to be done? I am spending 00 minutes right now to complete an assignment that is not going to be due in a few days. Why am I doing this right now, at midnight? Am I crazy? I do need to get some sleep. However, if I get some sleep right now, I can never get my stuff done. I am going to take a hip-hop/funk dance class. I got my flight ticket back to LOCNAME. I am so worried that I might have to cancel that flight when my bio professor said that the final is going to be on the 00th. I thought I might not be able to make it again. I had fun during critical thinking class. I mean, what is the purpose of taking critical thinking class? I do not get it. However, the class is pretty relaxing--so far. I wonder what the exam is going to be like. What about chemistry? How is the exam going to be like? I met some of my siser's friends. I met some new friends as well. I am still seeing some of my old friends. However, we don't see each other that often since we all have different classes on different time and date. On top of that, I have some friends that don't go to ORGNAME ORGNAME. I want to go to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I want a handbag. I bought myself a wallet. I went to Urban Outfitters. I will go broke if I keep on shopping. I don't shop that much. I don't really like going to mall. My sister loves going to mall. I think going to mall just to LOOK for stuff to buy is a waste of time. I would not do that unless I am extremely bored. Sometimes I like to buy artistic stuff. Am I artistic? I don't think so. I doubt it. I don't see myself as a creative person. I love sciences and maths. Those are my favorite subjects. I totally dislike government, history, geography, etc. I think psychology is interesting---so far it seems to be. I am all worn out. I had been up since 0:00 in the morning until right now. I had a really busy schedule. I want to go to my friend's apartment and start karaoke-ing. Is this the right spelling? No one will know anyway. I want to go back to LOCNAME and see what's going on over there. I want to see my friends in Houston/Sugar Land once again. I want to go to LOCNAME and start shopping. I want to go to LOCNAME LOCNAME and eat those delicious food. I need to get my homework done. So much to do, so little time. People who live right next to my apartment are kind of noisy. They party like almost every night. I totally understand that since this is Austin and all of them are UT students. I am just telling the truth here. No offense to anyone. Who will disagree on that? I want to sleep now. But I still need to write more and then do more reading. I don't want to be a know-nothing person when I go to bio lecture tomorrow. I can't believe I write that much in this short amount of time. I hate writing. Writing is not my strong part at all. I like to eat. I want to eat sushi right now. Korean food will do too. \nAsnwer:"
