The room feels stiff with warm air that has been dormant for days. The smell of warn-off room freshener and paint enraptures me as I look in perplexity at the clothes thrown carelessly on the floor. Two canvases lay on the stained carpet. The idea was to paint each one different, but to have the same motif. It was harder to come up with an idea than I thought it would be. That was a few hours ago, which was before I had a glass of the   fratty   punch.      It's so silly, how these fraternities make punch with around seventy-five percent alcohol. What are they trying to do to us? Women are not primitive. We understand what they have in mind. See, if it was up to the guys, they would drink heavy beer from noon until dawn. But it is the punch that us ladies enjoy, and that is clear enough evidence for the boys to work vigerously weekly on the near-poisenous beverages that they supply.      As I stood there earlier on the lawn in front of the frat boys' house, I suddenly asked myself a question.  Do these boys really want to talk to me?   I wondered.  And if they do. why?        Two things quickly were brought to my attention. One was the fact that if they did want to talk to me it was because they either liked my company, or that they liked the way they visioned me without my outfit on, one which by the way took me 00 minutes to pick out. How ironic huh?! The other was the fact that if they didn't desire to converse with me, that they had enough respect for me to actually return the small talk, and even at times initiate the redundant aquaintance talk so often practiced at frat parties.     It was then that I realized that either way, they were talking to me, and I got to talk to them just long enough to smell their woodsy cologne, as well as to look into their dreamy eyes!      Those stupid frat boys. Man are they dumb, but they sure are entertaining!!! \nAsnwer:"
