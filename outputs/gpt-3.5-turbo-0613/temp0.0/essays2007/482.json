I want a nice juicy ribeye steak back in LOCNAME. LOCNAME has the best restaurants. The night before I came to school I went to anthony's in houston. I had duck with cherry dressing. It was so good and the dessert was even better. We ordered practically everything on the menu. School is really different from high school. There is so much freedom compared to high school. Not only are parents out of the scene but teachers don't know if you show up to class or not. My bed is so comfortable. I put my two twin beds together and now I have a king sized bed. I love sprawling out on my bed after walking back from class or coming home from a night in LOCNAME. I love LOCNAME and I cannot wait until the first football game even though I am leaving town. I am going to LOCNAME for my grandmother's 00th birthday. It will be good to see my parents again. My sister is a senior at UT this year and she is going to graduate in the Spring. She is a PR major. This summer she interned for your daughter at Pennebaker Designs. Well I think that is 00 minutes so I am going to stop. I think I am going to go get something to eat. Pizza or maybe some quesadillas. \nAsnwer:"
