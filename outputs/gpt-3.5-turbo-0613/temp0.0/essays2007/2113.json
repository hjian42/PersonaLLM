This is kinda weird typing all my thoughts. My ring is broken. My ice cream is really good. That place down stairs has good ice cream. I'm tired. I need to go look for a new job today. I am going to 0 different Chili's to apply. I like my mousepad. My roommate just came in and it scared me. She just turned on the water. I'm thirsty. This ice cream is making me thirsty. I want to go home today. I miss my friends and family. But I'm not going to go home today. I am going to stay here. 00 minutes of writing your thoughts is a lot of time. which means a lot of thoughts. I have to read like 0 chapters for oceanography because I keep forgetting to read. So now I'm really really behind. I need to catch up so I don't fail. I need to go to the grocery and get some more food and drinks for in here. I'm almost out of Cokes because I go through them so fast. My roommate is talking to me about laundry. I haven't done laundry here yet. I went home last time to do it (to LOCNAME LOCNAME). She said the washing machines are really small and the dryers are really big. We just swept in here. It gets dirty pretty fast. And you don't even notice. I want a College of ORGNAME t-shirt. I saw one today but it was for the education council. and I don't think I want to join that. I don't like \"counseling\" haha. But really I don't like speaking in front of people or anything. So I'm sure that would not be fun for me. But-I don't know what I am talking about right now. PROPNAME just came online. Yay. He must have just woken up. It's kinda late. But he wakes up late. That's ok though. I wish I could sleep late. I have classes too early to sleep late. It's kinda weird because I don't like to go to bed early. So it would be really good if I had late classes. Education ORGNAME sounds like you just bond with the teachers and stuff. Like student council. So yeah-not for me. I like PROPNAME. I have not seen him in a while. I also have not seen PROPNAME PROPNAME in a while. My phone is ringing. Stop ringing. It's PROPNAME. I have not talked to him in forever. PROPNAME likes her pants. I have some like those. I got them from Target. I want to go shopping. I don't have any money though. I saw ORGNAME's sister in class the other day and I didn't know if it was her. So I didn't know whether or not I should say hi. But she had her eyebrow pierced so I didn't say hi. And I told PROPNAME that and she said I was lucky that I didn't say hi to her because she would have been really mean to me. That sucks. I don't like mean people. I hate making friends. It's so hard to be able to tell who your real friends are or not. I don't really have any friends here yet. I met one guy. And I have a few other friends who I see off and on. But still. All my friends left. Which is not very cool. I want to burn a CD. I have a whole bunch left. I need to renew my internet service. It doesn't expire til Sept. 00rd though. I need to look for those blue books. My spanish teacher said we need some for monday. And I have some because PROPNAME gave them to me. The lawns outside must be getting mowed. I hear a lawn mower. Anywho PROPNAME needs a blue book so I need to find them so I can give her one. So yeah. I like the pictures in my room. They remind me of my friends. I miss them. PROPNAME is having a lot of fun I think. She has 0 roommates but they all share an entire floor. And there are 0 bedrooms and 0 bathrooms and a living room and everything. That would be cool. I wish I had money to buy that here. But next year I am getting an apartment with PROPNAME I think. She wants to get fish but I don't like fish. They die too easily. PROPNAME gave me a big LOCNAME poster. She knows that I hate museums and stuff like that and she went to the PROPNAME PROPNAME museum with her family and got me that poster. To be funny. So now I'm going to put pictures of my friends like riding the horses and stuff. I just realized that my psych class is not 0 hours long. It's only 0 and a half hours. I just thought we got let out early all the time. 00 minutes is a long time. Although it seems a lot shorter when you type everything you're thinking. But that's still a lot of thoughts. I would hate to grade these things. Almost over. Only 00 seconds left. I want more ice cream so hurry up and finish. I need to get a new pencil sharpener. \nAsnwer:"
