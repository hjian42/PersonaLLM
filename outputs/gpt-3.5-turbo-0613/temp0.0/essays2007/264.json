No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Today is only the sixth official day of class, and I am already stressed out. I know that I don't necessarily have to do everything in one day, but I feel  just so overwhelmed with everything that is going on. I wish I was already set  into the swing of things and simply taking things one day at a time. I get  nervous every time I think of what possibly lies ahead. I also have to start  looking for a job. I feel I do not have the time to work, but I believe mom and dad when they say it will help me adjust better if I have set things to do. I  guess it will also help me manage my time better, possibly even help me. I mean 0-00 hours a week is not a lot and it could even be interesting depending on the type of job I could find. I can look in to this of Friday considering I only  have one class, although I seriously think I should take an extra hour or two  to simply lay down and rest. I haven't done that in a while. What else do I  have to do on Friday?  Look for a job, call home, rest, read, do homework, and  whatever else comes up. Let's see, Saturday. The game is on Saturday, so I  guess I will do game stuff most of the day and go out after the game. At least  I will be able to get off campus and breathe a little easier. So far, I guess I like it here. I mean I am having fun and enjoying myself but I just got use to  doing nothing during the summer. No reading, no calculus, no tennis, no PROPNAME. -Co. or ORGNAME meetings. Not to mention the constant weekend out of town tournaments. Yet, I do miss tennis. Even though it took up a lot of my time and effort, it  was always a blast. I miss the team especially, and all my close friends. I am  the only one of my closest friends that came to LOCNAME, but I guess it is all working out fine. If I went with them to college, I would be at ORGNAME. Naah, I'm OK here. I can always call them. I miss home. I knew that I would be homesick. Even  though I like being here, I sometimes wish I was still at home, in my house, with  mom, dad, and even PROPNAME & PROPNAME. Gosh, I never thought I would miss those two brats this much. OH, I miss grandpa and grandma and my nanny. I need to call  her tomorrow. It's already to late. I wonder what they are all doing right now. They are all probably asleep. I'm hungry, actually just thirsty. I could really go for a big, tall glass of sweet tea with a lot of ice. I can't wait for this  weekend. Hopefully I will be able to sleep in late, or at least till 00:00 am. Going to bed very late and waking up extremely early is just not a compatible combination. My legs are so sore from all the walking I have to do every day. I'm used to jogging and walking at least 0 miles most days, but walking here is  exhausting. Uphill, downhill, up and down stairs. Just thinking about it makes me tired. I need to get everything I need ready for tomorrow, but I think I am just going to lie down and watch TV till I fall asleep. I am so tired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \nAsnwer:"
