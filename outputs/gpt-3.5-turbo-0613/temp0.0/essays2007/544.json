No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Everyone likes to party, but at parties, the girls are very stingy and very hard to approach. Even though I am polite and nice. I consider myself and average looking guy, not ugly. So I don't see what the problem is. So far, the first 0 0/0 weeks of school, I have not yet to meet a nice girl. I don't know what's wrong. It is sort of making me depressed. During orientation it wasn't that hard for me to meet girls. So far, I still hang around my friends that I had during high school. I want to meet new people as well as keep my old friends. I hope the meetings at FSA and ORGNAME will aide me in meeting new people. The parties here are pretty cool though. I just wish they played different music. My neighbors seem pretty nice but they're total dorks. The girls on my floor are also hard to approach. I don't know if it's me. Maybe I'm thinking too much. The time I spend here seems to go by so fast. I get homesick quite often. I want to go back to LOCNAME. Maybe the homesickness will go away as time pasts by. I haven't been spending quite as much money as I planned to spend. so far I have spent probably around 00 bucks a week. which is average I guess. My classes so far has been good. I just hate oversleeping. Right now all of my thoughts seem to be about college. College is sort of a different experience for me, but its gradually absorbing into me. \nAsnwer:"
