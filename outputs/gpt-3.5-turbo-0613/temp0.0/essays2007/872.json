No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: okay, well to start off, I'm really not sure or confident of how my experience here at LOCNAME will effect me. \"will I succeed, or fail, only time will tell\", I really have a hard schedule for my first semester, a lot of memorizing, which I can do, but just don't want to put that much effort. Sound like I'm a no brainer, but if I have to do it \"ill do it\", that doesn't mean I want to. my goal is to have a midrange of a 0. 0 to 0. 0 avg. but right now I'm right this short writing assignment for Psy. and I reallly just can't seem to expand my thoughts on the consccious, I guess it's because the prompt says, think spontaneously, but how the hell do I do that if I'm under pressure. excuse my language. but just thinking spontaneously. well I really like this prompt, because there is no right or wrong answers and its just basically a written expression of how one's mind works. I'm not trying to kiss up or anythin, but really I do enjoy this. I would have hoped though, that the class would be a little smaller, so I could ask questions freely and not feel bothered, but that's no excuse I guess, what kind of reputation will I have amongst 00,000 people. Well my goal, is to continue doing well academically and also create a good social life. becoz I can't just study and have no fun, that's not in my domain. I've never had stress before, but I might break that barrier this semester. first day of class was pretty cool, because the professor , mr. peddebaker was pretty funny, and I hope I spelled his name right. anyway its a nice experience. I wonder how long it will take me to study for biology, thats probably my toughest class, coz I don't really enjoy it. I loved it at first, but then I took ORGNAME ORGNAME in high school, and my teacher made it so much work, and I didn't reallly get to enjoy it. it was not a fun learning experience. well it's been ten minutes, and ten more to go I'm really counting down dnow. I just say that click once to submit button ( click just onece on submit when you are done)  right now I'm watching this girl, while I type, write the longest email I've ever seen, and on lmy left that girl's writing one too,  god, don't they have somethin better to do? wrong statement, I was judging them, the truth is I probably write more emails then them. that 's because I lived in three different places less than thrree years. Los angeles for 00 and dallas for 0, and austin for one month. I'm movin like a train. but. well I forgot what I was going to write, ooopos oh well, I just got off my spanish class, and that profesor was pretty cool, although I understood his spanish better than his english. but it was still enjoyable. I want to join a fraternity, but I'm afraid I wont have time to do my schoolwork. but I still want to be social and everything like that, I guess is just another decision to think upon. oh my god, this girl stopped writing her email! the lab must be closing, nope, its not , just being sarcastic well I've got exactly five more minutes and I'm officially done with my first college assignment. I wonder how many words I've written,  babbling on and on is something I could do. well I just got a new neighbor in the lab, she's pretty cute, I wonder if I should talk to her,  naaaaa, seeems to involved with what shes about to do, oh well, maybe ill see her around, yeah right!, in this place no way. man I wish this one girl went here, PROPNAME, she was my high school crush, she was a good friend of mine but I never really asked her out or anythin, I thing she was dating someone at the time, oh wel, thats why I got to be aggressive over here, its a fresh new start. two more minutes left, well I just had to rub my nose it was itching, and fix my hair. well I got one minute maybe ill start on the other assignment, but I don't know how long that would. done \nAsnwer:"
