No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I've been thinking and this \"freshman fifteen\" thing has to be an urban legend. I mean, really, I've never walked so much in my entire life. Everything is about a fifteen minute walk from my dorm so I figure, if I walk to class to my dorm to class to lunch to my dorm, that has to be a few miles just walking the campus. Then I run errands and visit my friends and before I know it I've had an entire week's workout. And then when I have extra time I go to the gym and I know I'm not alone on this because it's always so damn full. For instance, tonight the entire weight room was full and every last piece of equipment was being used. So I know I'm not the only one who walks, like 00 miles a day and still goes to the gym. But let's suppose I rode the Campus Loop everywhere and didn't go to the gym, then would I gain weight? No because the Jester cafeteria is not somewhere I go for seconds. Of course the food isn't the worst I've ever eaten, but I'm definitely not going to over indulge in it. And on top of all of that they post the fat grams at the buffet line. There is no way to ignore the fact that you're eating unhealthy. It's all spelled out for you six inches from your face. Cheese Pizza: 00 grams of fat; Hamburger Topping: 0 grams of fat. How can you ignore that? But I guess these are all positive things because the freshmen fifteen is definitely something I want to avoid. I am willing to eat small portions of not so good food, walk 00 miles a day, and still go to them gym because Gosh Darn It! I will not gain the freshman fifteen. I will not. I won't let it happen. I will break the rules and not follow the fate of college students past. I can't do it. I won't do it. I will not gain the freshman fifteen. Besides, it's just an urban legend anyway. \nAsnwer:"
