I feel like I've always tried to be good and kind and honest, especially honest. Now, it's not like much of any of those, beause I am not right to PROPNAME. Oh PROPNAME, I don't know why I have done and do the things I do. Some people aren't right in your life. PROPNAME's right because he is comfortable. Others are old and dirty and uncaring. Yet, I am still spending all this time and energy on them. Not thinking much of myself, am I?  Do I? Will I ever? It's like I always have the right things all planned out--like PROPNAME tells me--but I never have the confidence to follow through with everything I dream or how I want or wish to be. I want to be strong and I don't want to be taken advantage of for the rest of my life. I want to be pretty and I want to be skinny like I was when I was fifteen with long brown hair. I can go back to that. I just have to run, run like I did and eat much less. I have a perfect vision of what I want to be but I always set myself up to fail. I won't follow through but I must. I must be honest with my feelings toward PROPNAME, not honest with what happenned, just with my feelings because I do care about him. I do. I don't want to hate myself right now. sometimes, someimes when I'm alone with my thoughts I think too much about all of it, I feel dirty, dirty and ashamed, and all I want is someone to hold me and tell me that they know and they still care and they still like me and they want to be there, that's what I thought PROPNAME was or is. critical though. He can be so critical, but he said he called--called like he nevercalls anyone he misses. He missed me enough to call me. more than I thought I would. we said more than we thought we would greg and nathaniel make me want to be a better person. I always want nathaniel to see me in the right way--he knows, greg too, they still care. But I am always like that questioning whether anyone does. maybe the thing will work and I will be happy- not eat more. iam afraid to eat more, but I probably won't if I do it right. But I want to get all nice looking for when I seee greg at Christmas. I want him to think I am pretty, he will, no more diritness-- it's ending soon, but I have to get the pictures back. I remember Saturday night. I couldn't even close my eyes or lay by myself. trouble sleeping. i had to go ly next to my mom . she cares she really does. I don't care what they say about her or think about her there's a love and care in her. she's really concerned about me. she wants me to get better. I'm trying. she doesn't know the dirty things--she has a nidea, but in it all she doesn't care she still loves me. I wish I could hug her. go back this weekend to houston like you always, do PROPNAME. try to be happy, think of others and fufill what you want of yourself be everything you want plus some-- now that's pretty. \nAsnwer:"
