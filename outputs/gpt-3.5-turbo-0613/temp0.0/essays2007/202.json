I wonder if anybody actually misses PROPNAME PROPNAME. \"No I don't Have a gun\"?  What? this is really a dumb song. leave it to a group named Nirvana, whose leader shot himself. ORGNAME ORGNAME, much better group. I wonder how many people have killed themselves because of PROPNAME PROPNAME death. That takes intelligence. PROPNAME's dead, life's not worth living. Why did I wait till the day before this is due to type it. Ohhhhhh I love this song. It reminds me of my boyfriend and I. \"When she says she loves me\". except I don't say I love him because according to every one of my friends I'm afraid to tell him I love him. Something about a fear of commitment and love. I guess it's all supposed to be ORGNAME\u2019s fault, my ex, for cheating on me every day for a year and a half. oh well. \" When she says she loves me. say you love, but you don't speak love\". Good song. I wonder how many people actually think about the words of the songs they listen to. Oh yah, classic Sting. I have absolutely no idea what the name of this song is. I never really liked Sting anyway. I should really be doing my other homework. What do I have to do? English paper, read my classic civilization, read my English, study Psy notes, and phl notes. I guess I can do most of it tomorrow. Third Eye Blind. Where do they get names for these groups?  Tomorrow is another day{Go PROPNAME}. I really don't want to go to work tomorrow. At least I have a decent boss for once, not some 00 year old pervert. what time is it? Wow 00 minutes really flies when your writing a paper that you can't possibly fail. I wish they were all that easy. Yah right. That probably wouldn\u2019t get me into ORGNAME ORGNAME. ORGNAME ORGNAME, four more years of college. Hopefully I can get through these first four. I can do it, because I\u2019m good enough I'm strong enough, and dog-gon it, people like me. Well it's been a great 00 min. I'll be back at it tomorrow to do the other paper. I need to do these more than a day before their due next time. \nAsnwer:"
