It is so differnt from what I thought it would be. Its mainly hard work, but you have a lot of free time to do whatever you want to. I get so bored just staying in my dorm room not doing anything. It is sooooooooo BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I rather go back to LOCNAME LOCNAME, and attend ORGNAME. Atleast its an smaller school, and I know a lot of people there. Wil I be able to go back this Labor Day weekend, to see everybody, and attend my aunt's weddinng?  I really really really really want to go back. It is sooooooooooo lonelky up here. I just sit in my dorm room and study myself to death. I barely hae any friends here. Most of my friend are back in WF. ORGNAME ORGNAME, Boy I wish I could be there right now. It has the most fun and memorable events that happen in my life. Those innoncent years, where you don't have to worry about anything. Your parents were always there for you. Now it seem like I'm on my own. This really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!0  I just want to be back home in my own bed, back at high schools being able to talk to the people I know in class. Being able to call teacher Mr. & Mrs. instead of Dr. now. What difference does it make????????  Its just a titile. The sun is shining bright today. Hopefully, my mood will be like that. I have been so down and homesick lately. I just wish I can just go home and be Mommy and Daddy little girl again. My aunt's wedding is this Saturday. I wonder if she'll make a pretty bride or not. School is driving me nuts here. So far, it has been pretty easy, but I don't know what will happen when all the mdterms come. I think I may bombed everything. I miss all my friends!!!!!!!!  I'm still am deciding wheter I should join a sorority or not. It is an easy way to make friends, but I heard that it was mianly parties, and I know that my parents will kill me if I become a party animal. The weather in LOCNAME is sooooo hot and humid. ORGNAME ORGNAME was hot, but not humid. The humid weather made it worse. I am thinking about my classes that will bother me tomorrow. Its sooooooooo  much work in chemistry and emerging scholars. I think it may not bother me that much but who knows what the future holds. Austin is such a lonely place with oiut a car. I heard 0th street is pretty fun. Maybe I should pay  a visit over there. BUt I heard that there are a lot of crazy people over there too. Man, life sucks doesn't it?  the fun things are always follow by danger. \nAsnwer:"
