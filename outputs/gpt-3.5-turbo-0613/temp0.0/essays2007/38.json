No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: My neighbor from across the hall is letting me use her computer because she is online. I went to PROPNAME and the lab was closed, that stunk. I'm very tired because I did not get very much sleep last night. Some girls on my wing and I were going to go to some Frat parties, but we wound up staying in the dorm and watching movies. It turns out one of my roommate\u2019s friends is also in this psy. class, I thought that was really neat, although the class is so huge, it doesn't surprise me. I haven't seen very many of my high school friends here at LOCNAME, I really didn't want to talk about college because that is the other assignment, but it seems to be the most foremost thing on my mind right now. The ORGNAME are kicking off their season tomorrow at noon!!!  I worked for them for about nine months, so I am somewhat obligated to watch, that and the fact that my step-father has been a fan for 00 years or so. I was able to get him a bluebook autographed by PROPNAME PROPNAME for Father's Day this year!  I really enjoyed giving that to him I love giving gifts, it's my most favorite thing to do!!!  I love to make people happy and some people think I'm crazy for that, but I think it's great. That's another reason I have enjoyed my intern ship with the ORGNAME so much. When I get a letter about a sick child, my heart sinks and to know that sending something from the ORGNAME will make them feel better or at least distract from the state they are in. Let's see 0 more minutes of writing. My roommate and I were talking about our special talents, I told her mine was finding holes in sidewalks!!  Yes, if I walk down LOCNAME, I WILL fall in every hole and look like a fool in front of at least 00 people that happen to be walking by!! That is something else, hey!! I just found out that my step-mom got a new car, and my dad bought her old one from her. This is a man who says he cannot send me $000 a month, but can take a two week vacation to LOCNAME LOCNAME and buy a new car in the same month!! Anyway, that subject somewhat depresses me. ok 0 more minutes of writing, I can handle it, hey I'll bet you can tell I'm a slow typer now, can't ya!!! Well it sure has been great talking to you. And as our good friend PROPNAME would say: Goodbye and good luck.     \nAsnwer:"
