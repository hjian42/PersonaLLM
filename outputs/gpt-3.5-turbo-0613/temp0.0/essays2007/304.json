    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I'm in the computer lab upstairs. I don't know what to write. there are a lot of people here. the computer next to me is broken but I don't know how. the guy who was sitting there earlier was kinda cute in a nerdy sort of way. some guy just walked behind me. there was a loud noise just now. don\u2019t know what it was though. kinda scared me cause I thought I did something wrong and the people who control the computers would come after me and make me pay a million dollars for the entire system. wow the girl next to me got a long email. I got a few emails today. why do people wear socks with sandals?  don't they know it doesn't look good?  the computer screen is huge. I bet you a million dollars that this is the stupidest writing assignment you will get back from a student. I don't really measure up to the rest of the class. wow the girl next to me is typing really slowly. I'm in the I section. how come on some computers I and l look the same and they also look like 0. ewwwwww that girl should NOT be wearing something so tight. I've been at this computer for a long time. how come there are so many blonde people here. I wouldn't want to have yellow hair. I want headphones so I can listen to music. I'll bring them next time. I'd do this from my room, but I don't have my Ethernet set up because the computer store doesn't have any software there. recycling is weird. why don't they make it a law that you have to recycle. and if you don't recycle, you get fined like a million dollars. why do people read when they should log onto their computer?  I mean, there are TONS of people waiting to use computers and then you have people like this who read instead of type. why do people sit at booths in the cafeteria alone?  don't they have common sense?  a booth is not for one person. it's for more than one person. that's why there are tables everywhere. so you can eat at tables alone in the corner instead of taking up a whole booth alone. there should be a law against that. I\u2019d enforce it. Emily's boyfriend's name is PROPNAME. that's my boyfriend's name. only her boyfriend is close by. mine is far. it's sad. she's going to go out with me and her boyfriend this weekend. she's gonna have sex with him. I want to have sex. but PROPNAME\u2019s so far away right now. I have a chem test on Wednesday. I\u2019m scared. I think I\u2019m gonna fail it. I have to study. tonight is Melrose place though so I can't study at 0. I\u2019ll study after that. I wanna party. I drank too much coke today. i want water. I\u2019m hungry. man it's cold here. how come my room is so cold?  I want to change the temp but then it might be too hot. every place is freezing here and it's hot as hell outside. is hell a bad word?  why do people think it's bad?  and why is God Damn so bad?  you can say ass on TV but not god damn?  and who decided it was bad anyway?  I wrote a high school essay about it one time but I have no idea. why are bad words bad words?  who decided they were bad. I want glasses. I think it makes you look smarter if you get a good pair that is. the computer next to me is broken. that noise was loud again. same noise as before. green is a cool color. forest green though. not the crappy lime greens and other green colors. forest green. aha!  I\u2019m right under the vent. that's why I\u2019m freezing. I can't wait for Melrose place tonight. I\u2019ve been waiting all summer for it. do you think PROPNAME's gonna leave?  she can't. she's my favorite. I\u2019m glad PROPNAME left. PROPNAME\u2019s a whiner. glad they killed PROPNAME off. ever watch 00000?  it's stupid. why do they have Braille on the number things that say what station you're on?  How would a blind person use a computer?  I want email. I get a ton of it but I want more. I want real letters though. I want to go down to the mail place and be able to say \"WOAH I GOT MAIL\". :( This paper was a cool one to write. I wanna do it again but I'll have to wait until tomorrow. I skipped class today. don't know why. I was lazy. I need to shape up or ship out. I never liked that phrase. who wants to ship out?  how can you ship out?  we're all on land. not at sea. PROPNAME\u2019s joining the navy. I wish he wouldn't go. I want him to move here. why do people wear fanny packs?  they're not flattering. too many sorority chicks here. we have 0 kappa deltas on our floor. valley girls. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I don't. do they make the whole school do it?  I love the smell of freshly done laundry. I did my laundry already but I want to do it again so it'll be all warm and smell good. I want to go to a party. I want to get drunk like on my vacation. not that drunk though. just drunk enough to have fun. wow that guy's cute. he looked at me. woo hoo. there are a lot of old people here. old old old. I wanna be older but I don't wanna get OLD. just hit submit and you'll get it huh?  that's cool. I still have to find my way here one more time to write it again. wow so much fun. there are too mane people here waiting for computers. I should go downstairs next time. warning!  when you log out all your files will be erased. duh. save em loser. psychology. how come every frat boy and sorority chick majors in psych?  how many psychologists can the world have?  did you know ORGNAME is the slacker school of the nation. I read that somewhere. isn't that cool?  this place is huge. wow he's a hippie. what am I?  normal. abnormal. quiet. loud. who knows?  I\u2019m me I guess.
