I hope my parents are settling down up in  LOCNAME with good business and a place to live. I hope no conflicts will occur although I know they are going to fight one in awhile. I miss my mom the most. she cried at the airport and I can still see those tears in her face. her voice was so weak when I called to say hello. is this it to college life? I wonder where PROPNAME is has he called me and left me a message? I have precal class with him first thing tomorrow morning and I don\u2019t know where to go yet. I hope to get my beeper soon because I needed really bad and I don\u2019t know when ill get it. as I look at the screen I wonder if the writing will ever go down onto the next line, or will it go on forever. I really want to go home  I feel as though I have to be with her 00/0 and I feel like she'll follow me everywhere I go. I don't want her to , but at the same time I don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings. I hate it when she smokes she smelt so bad in the classroom wow it finally has moved down to the second line. this stream of conscious writing is kinda pain in the butt because it is nearly impossible to actually start typing without thinking about what to type. lookin at the screen uhhh she wants to come over today but I don\u2019t want her to I feel as though she's gonna stick with me wherever I go and I feel like she's never gonna find a friend to hang out without me. but I shouldn\u2019t think like this because she\u2019s my friend and we've known each other forever. but I feel that she\u2019s going to hold me back in the future as we go on. either that or we're gonna fall apart, not easily, but  I feel that someone\u2019s gonna get hurt and I don\u2019t want to be the one hurting her. my head itches. I gotta go home and call my mom and talk to my dad. I wish they had the same kind of water here as LOCNAME. their water is so nice. I would like to know if PROPNAME likes me or just as friends because he actually we act the same way towards each other but I don\u2019t know if I like him or not so I wonder if he feels the same way. my pastor is here from LOCNAME to teach bible study and I kinda feel guilty because I said I\u2019d see him and stuff when he is down here but I cant get my self to go and sit and listen to him. I feel bad. I wonder what lee is doing he seem so quiet yet outgoing but not really I would like to get to know him but I wonder if he even knows that I exist. I think he does but who knows. sitting here typing wondering what time it is . what can I eat for dinner? I have an eye appointment tomorrow and I want to meet PROPNAME somewhere so we can go to class together. cant wait to go home I\u2019m kinda glad I didn\u2019t room with her I can't imagine how hurt she'll be if she really knows how I feel. she gets on my nerves time to time and she asks me if she gets on my nerves, but I can never tell her that she does because I don\u2019t think its right. I want my friends to come over to my apartment but I don\u2019t know how my roommate is going to react. how am I suppose to find a roommate for next semester when she leaves . it almost time to go  I hope they don\u2019t make us read this later on in the semester. I think I really want a boyfriend but not really, I don\u2019t know what I want. PROPNAME is pretty cute only if he was taller I would fall for him so hard. but I\u2019m glad we're good friends. I\u2019m kinda glad that they broke up too. I think she\u2019s too self fish and he can do so much better. I better memorize the medical terminology by Thursday. what should I do this weekend I bet she wants to come with me I feel as though every time I\u2019m with her I\u2019m blocked off from the crowd in a way I\u2019m uncomfortable with her around other people. I wish she stop smoking she  looked so crappy up times up and I don\u2019t feel like typing any more. \nAsnwer:"
