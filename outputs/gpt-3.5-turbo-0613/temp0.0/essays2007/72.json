    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I hate computers. I think I hate them because I do not understand them. This assignment is hard because I am trying not to think about the assignment and just write about what is in my head. Why is this just continuing on one line?  Am I doing this wrong?  Should I fix the grammatical errors that I make?  I feel stressed I have only been here for a couple weeks. What could I possibly be stressed about?  I need to talk to PROPNAME. I need to talk to him tonight. This is a time in my life where I am supposed to try new things, meet new people, further my education. I do not need a serious boyfriend now. Why is he so nice?  Did he see this coming?  Is he trying to make this harder for me?  No. What am I talking about?  He is always this nice. He is such an incredible guy. Bad timing. This always happens to me. I will not miss experiences in college like I did in high school because of some guy. I need to see what it is like not having some guy around me all the time. PROPNAME might be right. I might be afraid of being by myself. I will talk to him tonight. I probably will not. How can I possibly be mean to someone who is so wonderful?  He won't understand. I know this is the best thing for me. I need to learn how to operate e-mail. I want to start sending mail to my brother. PROPNAME better come to LOCNAME to see me soon. My sister better come soon, too. I cannot believe that the one weekend I really want to go home (homecoming) I have to stay here and be formally initiated into my sorority. It is PROPNAME's birthday. I am so Jealous that PROPNAME gets to go see everyone and I will not. We have been talking about how fun that weekend will be since homecoming last year. This sucks. Everyone will be home. I wish the girls in this dorm were a little more considerate. They see me studying in here and they are still so loud. I hope I do not do the same thing. I am having so much fun here, yet I am still stressed about maintaining my friendships with my best friends from home. I hate it that one of my best friends is here in LOCNAME. It puts such a damper on our friendship. I am just so busy right now. I never realized how much time this sorority would take up. Am I neglecting one of best friends?  Does she resent the fact that I am making new friends?  I love that girl. With everyone else, we know why we haven't seen one another. PROPNAME. What am I going to do?  I am having to talk myself into doing this. I know I need to see what it is like to date other people. I think PROPNAME has something to do with this. I think PROPNAME is so wonderful because PROPNAME was so horrible. I wonder what PROPNAME is doing. I wonder if he is ended up going SAE. I wonder if he has a girlfriend. I wonder if he is a possessive weirdo to her. Why do I care?  No, PROPNAME is wonderful. Am I going to regret this?  What if he starts dating someone else and it breaks my heart. I need to do this. I am so far behind. I need to learn a little about time management. I think I am getting sick. I keep feeling like I am about to sneeze. I need to quit smoking. I would like to smoke right now. Why do I think when I am stressed that a cigarette will make me feel better. I should talk my father into buying me a computer for Christmas. I think that would be a good idea. I am going to be here for a while. I really need to start thinking of what it is that I want to do. Am I taking pointless classes?  Do I always ask myself questions?  I was really insulted by those stupid papers that basically said that I was in the lowest percentile of students at this university. I have to do well this year. I need to get my act together. It is so hard to just sit in my room and study. I should probably spend more time at the library. What could I be distracted by there?  I am asking myself too  many questions. I need some sleep. I think I am going to sneeze again. I hate that feeling.           \nAsnwer:"
