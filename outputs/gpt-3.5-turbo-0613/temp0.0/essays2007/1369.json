I should have gotten one when I went home labor day weekend. But I didn't. I wanted to go home this weekend, really only so I could get a haircut, but I didn't. My hair is getting entirely too long. At least for me it is too long, I mean I don't have a pony tail or anything but still. I forgot to see when I started writing. Oh well I'll just estimate. I really need to get a cell phone. Of course I would turn it off in my psychology class unlike some dumb asses in there. I mean how stupid do you have to be to not check and see if your phone is on even after the professor tells you to make sure they are off. I suppose they might leave it on once or forget they have it in their backpack or perhaps their friend put their phone in their bag and forgot about it, but it can't help but kind of piss you off when a phone rings in class. All I think is, \"what a dumb mother fucker. \" Hey look, ORGNAME word doesn't recognize the word fucker. Hey it doesn't even recognize the word ORGNAME. My head itches. Because my hair is too long. I need to go to the optometrist and get new contacts. I think I've had these for over a year now. I'll probably get them the same color, aqua. Man it is hot outside, it must be about 00 degrees. Not that I am any good at estimating but hey. Like I can't estimate a girls weight worth a shit. Or a person's age. Of course if a guy is smart, he doesn't try to estimate a girls weight. I need to go to the restroom. My stomach is growling. Man my nose is itching too. I miss PROPNAME. Damn she is beautiful. I wonder if she's thinking about me right now. She is probably in 0th period right now, whatever class that is for her. I wonder if she is pregnant. If she is it's probably mine. Great, just great. I'm fucked. Then again that's what got me in this position in the first place. Speaking of positions, I wish PROPNAME was here now. I want to go home this weekend. Not so I can go home this weekend, but so I can get a haircut and see PROPNAME. I wish I had my car so I could just go wherever I wanted whenever I wanted. Then I would probably be out partying and stuff all the time. \nAsnwer:"
