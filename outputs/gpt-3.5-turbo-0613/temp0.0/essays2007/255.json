I have just finished my final class for the day, so I figured that I would go ahead and get caught up on my homework for my psychology class. I have never taken any kind  of psychology class, so I don't really know what to expect. Hopefully it won't be a hard class because some of my other ones are pretty hard, and I wasn't use to doing a lot of work and studying in high school. I liked high school a lot, and kind of wish that I was still in it. I sort of miss all of my friends and it just isn't the same to party without all of them. I went home for the Labor Day holidays and partied with them, but now that I'm back in LOCNAME everything has changed back again. I haven't really met many people since I've been here, but I can say that there are quite a few weird people. Hopefully I will get use to LOCNAME soon because it hasn't really worked out too well just yet. I've  already received two speeding tickets, a parking ticket, and had my truck towed once since I moved in two weeks ago. My parents aren't too happy with me right  now, so I've got to get good grades to get them off of my back. I keep screwing  up on this computer and don't really know what I'm doing. I never have been too good with computers-even though I have taken several classes in high school. I  can type rather quickly, but that is about all. My fingers are getting tired of typing because I haven't typed all summer. I guess I need to get use to it since I'm going to be doing a lot of it now that I'm in college. I'm not too happy  right now because I have to type this paper in the lobby computer room. I just  brought back with me a notebook computer that my mom gave me, but I can't get the CD-ROM to work. The stupid thing won't read the disks for some reason, so I haven't been able to hook up the UT Connect package that I just bought. I think I made a few people mad when I went to purchase that UT Connect package because  there was a long line and I sort of cut to the front on accident. I was just  trying to ask the person a question about what line to get in, and he thought  that I had already been waiting, and that it was my turn. Even though the guy that I cut in front of looked kinda pissed, I wasn't about to turn around and  get at the back of the line. Last week I waited in it over an hour and even  though I feel kinda bad for that guy, it was worth it. My eyes are getting tired of staring at this screen and I'm for my time to be up. I guess I still have a  few minutes until dinner starts so I'll write for a little while longer. I didn't get much sleep last night because I just couldn't fall asleep for some reason. Some friends and I watched the movie The Program, and that lasted until about 0:00, and I still couldn't go to bed after that. I didn't have to wake up until 00:00, but I only had like 0 hours of sleep. Hopefully I can go to bed tonight with no problem. My hands are getting a little sweaty from typing so much, but I really do like to type. I'm not all familiar with the internet and the web, but  I would like to be. I'm in an English lab class, so that will probably help me out a lot. I'm sitting next a guy that can type about 000 words a second-at least that's what it sounds like-and it is kind of getting on my nerves. \nAsnwer:"
