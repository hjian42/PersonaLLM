No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: my knuckles are aching I'm going to pop them, lot of clicking on the keyboards in the computer lab, I keep hearing a long beep ever now and then and it is really annoying, I wish I could type better and faster and not have to use one finger, my joints are still aching I want to constantly move to pop them, my head itches and my armpits are moist and sticky, I keep having to raise my arms to keep the stickiness down and more my shirt out of my pits, my toe needs to pop and my right ring finger itches, I wonder what jenn is doing I bet she is with gus, gosh do I hate that guy he just gets on my nerves and doesn't deserve her or treat her right, but then he is cool when I'm around very annoying, it rained earlier so it was really humid after psychology, but now the air conditioning in the library is just what I need, the back of my shoe has no fabric on it so where my sock is not present my shoe rubs blisters into the flesh, another chair squeaks as some shifts their weight, a guy is talking on his phone which I always thought was a bad idea and now he is done, the weird thing about this assignment is that all I'm really thinking about is the assignment and having to think things up, I feel like it doesn't accurately establish what I'm think because I I can't type as fast as a thought comes up, my eye is burning and I feel a tear coming up its like an uncontrollable itch that I'm going to have to rub for a while, another phone goes off, its amazing how many phones there are and how everyone has their own little ring, now someone won't answer their phone and it is still going off, my knee itches, I scratch it, a zipper is undone, another person leaves the computers, and another one sits down automatically, to guys are talking and kind of annoying me, walking around with their smug looks and acting like they own it all and don't have to abide by any rules of SILENCE, that same beep again, I scratched my knee again, I wonder what I'm going to make for dinner, I'm really hungry right now but I still have my lab, stupid labs all at weird times and all out of whack, some one coughs over the loud and oddly rhythmic type emulating from about 00 computers, I shift my weight because my ass is falling asleep and cause my chair to creek as everyone takes a pause to listen look and become annoyed, more squeaking, and now my forearms are sore from resting on the edge of the table to long, I really worry about problems with my hands from typing and using a mouse and also from popping my knuckles, carri's dad has I guess a calcium deposit on his knuckle from clicking a mouse too much its pretty deformed looking, but funny, the library seems to weirdly old yet modern, a lot of the signs make me think of my elementary school and just stuff from then like the walls but its so enormous and imposing I completely stop thinking about it, I sneeze and cover my mouth but now I type so I spread my saliva everywhere I feel bad for who ever uses this next, knuckles again, some guy is looking out if the window and I want to know what he is thinking and what he is looking at, I was thinking about this one think dr. PROPNAME was talking about how we are all programmed to react to movement and sound, I guess I always knew and tried to avoid it but I don't think many people actually think about it, I think its actually pretty cool because I'm now thinking about how it is one those derived characteristics we got from our ancestors I guess who hunted or had natural predators just being able to react when ever something moved or made a noise, probably a good thing not to evolve out  of, 000 rocks evolver is a good step up for them, I notice I get really startled easily when I'm alone in my room engulfed in tv or a computer, my mom and anyone can come in and say hi and ill jump like the dickens even though it was not that big of a deal I wish jenn felt the same way it would be nice and also bad because \nAsnwer:"
