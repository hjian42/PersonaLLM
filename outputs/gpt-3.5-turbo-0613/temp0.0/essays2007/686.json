No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am hoping that I will be able to keep up with my thoughts for twenty minutes. It is only 0:00 and I still have 00 minutes to go. I wonder if PROPNAME is doing ok. I hope he ate. I was really happy to see him eat so much at lunch today. I hope I don't get in trouble for sitting with him in his cafeteria. Today was so hot. I am definatley wearing shorts tomorrow. But that shirt is dark red, I hope it won't absorb too much heat. I must have lost at least 00 lbs of water today. It is riduculous how bad my schedule is. One hour in class, the next three sitting somewhere. God, finding FAC is going to be my semester goal. I can't believe how hard it is to find that building. No one else has trouble finding it but me. Maybe I have some kind of direction learning disability. I wonder if I have missplelled any words. does misspell have a hyphen? My head hurts. I must be because I am tired. Maybe because I have had my hair pulled back all day. I hope I can find that building tomorrow before I go to class. I hope history isn't boring. With my luck it will be awful. An hour and a half contemplating how the Germans felt about this and that. Why did I sign up for that class. I am doing a pretty good job typing. I hope they didn't want this in a certain form. ORGNAME is such a waste of money. I wonder if PROPNAME got me into the draw. I hope so. I can't wait till the game on Saturday. It will be so much fun. I hope his roomate likes me. I felt weird today just sitting there. I need to make some friends. My head hurts so badly. I need to go to bed early tonight. I don't have to get up half as early tomorrow as I did today. I think we are going to have to find a better way of comunicating. I was almost in tears when I couldn't find him. I wonder if he was mad at me. I hope not. I wish he would show more interest in me. Hopefully it is just because school started today. I guess they call it class and not school. I really didn't feel overwhelmed today. I am so tired. Only ten more minutes. I feel like I am writing a letter. I wonder how PROPNAME and PROPNAME are doing. I haven't heard from LOCNAME in about four months. She can be ridiculous when she wants to be. I wonder if she thinks I moved? I hope she doesn't come here for college. i know I would have to be her room mate and everything I did would be reported to everybody and their brother. I wonder why I have been using \"everybody and their dog\" latley. Perhaps no one has heard and their brother, so I feel weird saying it. I was really amazed that I got that great spot in the garage today. I think it was the same one that I parked in last night. I felt really bad for using the elevator to go up one level, but my hip was hurting terribly. It better go away for tomorrow. I hope I didn't miss a class today. All these discussion classes are going to drive me insane. Life would be much easier if I had a decent schedule. i think she is going deaf. Between the two of them, my God. She has been edgy lately. There can't be much stress doing what she does. What would happen if she saw this. I wonder if she would get upset and yell. Probably. I can't wait till it gets cooler. Better yet, I can't wait till Christmas break. I wonder how many people at UT celebrate Christmas. I need to start shopping for presents. I need to wrap the gifts that I have. PROPNAME's birthday is in A FEW DAYS. Where does the time go? I wonder if this rambling means I'm crazy? I wouldn't be surprised. I can stop now. \nAsnwer:"
