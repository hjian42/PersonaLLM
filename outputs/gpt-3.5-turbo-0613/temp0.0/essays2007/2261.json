I never set aside just some time for me to type and write and think. It's crazy that my thoughts are not really coherent. tiffany is typing next to me--her music is  loud and kind of weird. I'm not a big fan of rap. wow look at how the font looks smaller after  you don't capitalize. tiff's talking to me and going into the bathroom. Stupid homework. I am  typing but I don't know what I'm thinking about. man it's so loud in our room. she's yelling at  me. she wants me to finish my work so I can talk to her. silly girl. the TV is kind of annoying I  want to turn it off but it's so far away. college is making me lazy. that reminds me of PROPNAME's  inferno. I can hear the wretch is that how you spell it? wrench clanking in the background. tiffany is struggling to put our brand spanking new fluffy toilet seat onto the crappy and dirty  jester toilet that who knows how many people have urinated in gross!! I realize that even  though I am writing my thoughts down as I type, some of my thoughts are not being recorded  in this stream of consciousness writing because my mind is going crazy and I can think about a  billion things at once but I can't type it all fast enough. stupid fingers! type faster! type faster!  this is such a crazy assignment. I love how unstructured college is. I love how you can do  whatever you want and no one gives a damn. it's pretty spiffy! some girls is getting her face  redone for plastic surgery. I'm glad I'm not heinously ugly or I'd be tempted to get some plastic  surgery done too. crazy. crazy reminds me of a song. can't remember which. man I kind of miss  high school. those days of knowing everyone in all of your classes--- I'm sad that they are  over. now I walk into class and I'm lucky if I know one person. got to meet some friends. but  PROPNAME is kind of holding me back. I love him but I don't know if I can take his clingininess! he's  such a sweet guy but I wonder what it would be like to be single again. wow look at how much  I've typed. I love my new ibook. it's so cute. I just want to look at it all day. how cute is it!  right. dang I'm weird. noises in the background are distracting me now. too bad I can't reach  over real fast and turn off the stupid TV. I really think that TV dumbs people down. interesting. my fingers look weird when I type. they look like little spiders. ha-ha. website! that's the weirdest  word. weird. indweirdo. too bad jaya and I aren't really friends anymore. she's in psycho with  me though--maybe we can rekindle out old friendship. PROPNAME was so mean to me. oral interp  man-- at least I made some more friends. don't need friends like that anyways. JESUS!! LOVER  OF MY SOUL! JESUS! I WILL NEVER LET YOU GO!!! dang I wish that I could see PROPNAME now. I know  that faith is what makes Him real to us, but wouldn't it be cool of they could make some PROPNAME  bears to hug when you're sad? I miss my parents a lot. actually, I just miss my mom!! *sigh*. it's  all good. PROPNAME the printer. ha-ha bio II. such a good class to go to. I love the learning, hate  the quizzes and tests. high school was hard. waking up early to study, staying up late to study. bummer! and all to get into a college to repeat the cycle all over again. man it's weird not to  have my parents around! why do people have rhinoplasties? they're so nasty!  ccccccccccccccrunk is what that is! tupac. why do people die? I so do not even get it. I think  about death in that it's scary. I believe in Jesus, so will I definitely go to heaven? I'm such a  reasoning person that I wonder if there is a heaven sometimes. but that's sin. purgatory  according that PROPNAME inferno website is where I'm going. yay! will see the Son and the Father  one day. I need to use the bathroom. dangit. still have 0 minutes left. my hands are kind of  sweaty. gross! man what a loser. this girl is 00 on TV and wants a nose job to feel better about  herself. that's so crazy. why are people so low self-esteem? like ling. dang that girl acts like  she's all that, but she has no self esteem at all! it's all an act, a facade. yay! my battery is  charged up to 00%. the % button is always above the 0. weird, eh? eh? mission! that reminds me  of PROPNAME and mission trips. I wish I had gone to LOCNAME LOCNAME with everyone this year. I almost  feel like I let God down. your love is amazing. your love is amazing. Your love is amazing to me. my grammar and punctuation sucks. man I wonder what she's doing. haven't talked to that girl  in forever. I can't believe I've been typing for almost 00 minutes! this is nuts. ha-ha PROPNAME  from full house. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is so hot. gosh' can't believe he's marrying PROPNAME PROPNAME. wonder what sofa and PROPNAME are doing at ORGNAME right now. ORGNAME-- that's the root of all of  ORGNAME's problems. that's why he's so clingy and insecure. I want to help him. but how? man  these apples are cute!!! the little apple logo makes me feel all warm and fuzzy! ahhhhhh the  door is not locked! tiff forgot to lock it. got to lock it after I'm done with this thing. I'm getting  tired now. I want to watch love actually. that's such a freaking' cute movie. freaky Friday. ha-ha  PROPNAME PROPNAME and her weird boobs. no way can a teenage girl grow boobs that fast! why are  guys so obsessed with boobs? freaks me out. anyways let's change the topic. I wonder if dr. PROPNAME or his TAs will read this. poor people their eyes must be boggling out by now from  all the reading. tiff is drumming on the toilet seat. gross! she put my stuff on that dirty grout- stricken floor. the time is going by freakishly fast. dude it's already 00 minutes and counting. I  kind of don't want to stop doing this. maybe I'll keep an online diary just for myself to do this  everyday. how do you know who you will marry? how do you know you won't get sick of them?  000. scary day. PROPNAME's birthday. the phone is ringing. the door opens. flip flops are dirty. I feel  like a loser sometimes. but this is not a cry for help. I love you JESUS! hahha I hope whoever  reads this doesn't think I'm a loser. the little AIM man looks funny. I can't wait to read this after  I'm done with everything. I want to see what I was thinking. Kim basinger and this dude are on  TV for this new movie. who sometimes movies really scare me. like PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME in the  new movies. tiff is wailing. she forgot about a homework assignment. uh-oh. doesn't sound  good. my tummy feels weird. I think I'm getting fat. out!! peace \nAsnwer:"
