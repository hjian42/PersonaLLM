Right now, I have so many different feelings inside me right now. This is a new part of my life, yet it does not feel all that different. I guess it's because there are so many familiar faces here and I'm still pretty close to home. I'm kind of glad about that, it makes me feel much more secure. I really want to take full advantage of my college life. I want to meet people, I want to have fun, I want to experience everything, and I want to do all that and keep myself on track. I signed up for a ballet II class and a street jazz class over at the union the other day. I figured that while I did not want to get heads over heels into dance again, I definitely didn't want to give it up because I still love it, so this was great for me because it will be a casual class and it's basically right across the street from me. I also signed up for an informal ice skating class. Figure skating was such a big part of me, but when I got too busy with LOCNAME, I had to stop, so I figured that now was the perfect time to start again. I knew it would be a beginner class, but I figured that it'd be good to work on basics. I took the bus there, got there late, and they were doing twofoot glides. No offense, but it truly was a beginner class. Afterwards, PROPNAME (the teacher) saw me jumping and spinning on my own, so she's putting me in the more advanced class after the beginner class, which was really cool. I also met these two girls, PROPNAME and PROPNAME, who were also in my class. They were so nice, they got off the ice before I did, but they actually waited until I got off and then they told me that they could bring me to and from the rink from now on so I wouldn't have to ride the bus, which I thought was just so incredibly nice of them. PROPNAME brought me home, and PROPNAME gave me her number so that I can call her next week and she can bring me there. I was very happy last night because 0) I restarted a hobby that I truly have a passion for, and 0) I met new people and I feel like I am starting to create a new world for myself. Seriously, that is one of the reasons that I loved figure skating so much, not just that I love the sport and that I love gliding across the ice and flying in the air to music, but because when I was skating, I was in my own world. It was like my safety, my refuge. So I am feeling very good that I am beginning to regain that. You don't realize how much you miss something until you actually do it again. I've been pretty happy with everything for the most part. It's been a nice and rather smooth transition, because it didn't feel like I was making too big of a transition. The main difference to me is that I don't have to worry about being home by a certain time to avoid making my parents mad. I don't have to worry about making my mom mad (because she takes everything so personally) and all that sort of stuff. I've been thinking about PROPNAME every now and then. Just passing thoughts about him, wondering what he's up to, if he thinks about me, that sort of stuff. It's not like I spend all of my time thinking about him, but he passes my thoughts very often. I guess he'll always mean a lot to me. It's funny, because I've been so happy with everything lately, but today, I am feeling particularly angry with PROPNAME. Just how judgmental she is upon me and how overly selfrighteous she is. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that (being selfrighteous), but with her, it is to a fault. It's to a point where she's hurt me and insulted me and angered me. And she claims to be watching out for me because she cares, but that's not what I call leaving me to find my own ride. She's let me down in a big way and she has no right to treat me like that. I'm not normally an angry person, but I am really upset with her right now! I really just don't want to talk to her for a while. Going back to LOCNAME this weekend was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed seeing everybody again, although it was only for a little bit. One thing I like about having high school people here at LOCNAME is that even if I wasn't friends with them back in LOCNAME, it's kind of like, now that we're at college, we have some sort of bond because we're from the same place, so we become friends, which is really cool. Anyhow, my twenty minutes are up, so I'll talk later! That's basically me for right now (or all that I can think of and remember right now anyways)! \nAsnwer:"
