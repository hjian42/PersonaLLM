There is so much on my mind that I do not even know where to start. PROPNAME is trying so hard to get PROPNAME to live with her and it works out great if he does, but I just do not know how it will work. if my sister starts to bother him then he will tell me about it, and by the same token if he bothers her I will be the first to hear it. I do not understand why I am so lazy lately. it took me an hour to just decide to get down here to do this and all of my other classes are the same way. I am so nervous about trying out for spirits and dance team on Wednesday I just do not know if I can do it, it all sounds like fun, but what if ORGNAME and PROPNAME get in and I don't? I am the one who told PROPNAME about it in the first place and I don\u2019t think that it would be fair. I need to get my room clean before mom and dad get home , do some homework, take a nap, read a few chapters for psychology, I\u2019m so glad that I got PROPNAME\u2019s drivers license mailed to he she\u2019s probably going to be pissed off because it took so long but I have just been so busy. I wonder how she\u2019s doing since PROPNAME\u2019s not around/ maybe ill call her later after I have done everything else. . I totally forgot to tell PROPNAME that I got a 00 out of 0 on my very first math quiz. mom should be happy, she'll probably just say it was easy anyway but I\u2019m happy about it and I know PROPNAME will be too. some time soon I need to go to the mec to find out if my Spanish credit is in yet. I cant believe I never would have guessed in a million years that I would be a sophomore in college by the end of my first semester. PROPNAME and I are going to be late to dinner at cricky's tonight if he has to mow so many people's yards, but why am I worried about it they talked an agreed on a certain time then its none of my business. I hope he wont get rid of PROPNAME, I love that cat and if I did not live at home I would take her. maybe PROPNAME and I will get married at the end of this year after all then we wont have to worry about stupid little things like this and rent will be alot easier to pay if there are two of us contributing to the cause. I wonder what our babies are going to be like. I think that all of the boys will be just like him, moody. what will it be like to engaged as sophomores in college, that is if we aren't engaged in a month that would be wonderful I know it would motivate me to work alot harder. \nAsnwer:"
