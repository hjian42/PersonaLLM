No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Okay, well,  I am watching the movie XXX\"  I'm not really watching it because I'm typing, but I'm listening to it. I really can't type that well, so there are probably going to be a few misspelled words. My sister made me mad a while ago because I asked her to call me when her husband got home and she didn't. I looked outside because they live next door to me and his truck was there. I was like \"Okay, why hasn't she called me?\"  Oh well, whatever. Oh, I don't know what to do. My friend hooked me up with her friend PROPNAME. He is really nice, but I feel bad being with him because I'm still in love with my ex boyfriend PROPNAME. Well, my friend PROPNAME told me that PROPNAME already loves me. That's not cool because we've only been together for like 0 days. I love PROPNAME so much!  I don't know. Man, I just heard somebody. I hope it wasn't my mom. She is always bothering me. We really don't get along. I came home and my room was a little rearranged. I know that my mom was in my room. She was probably looking through my things. That's not even cool because I had a letter by my bed that had some very personal things written in there. I'm pretty damn sure that my mom read it. She is always going through my things. I think that I probably should've lived on campus or maybe got an apartment. She is always yelling at me like if I'm a little kid. I need to get a cell phone because she is always getting mad because people are calling me. She gets mad when she doesn't recognize their name. She comes and asks me \"Who's so and so?\"  She also gets mad because my friends call me late. They call me at like 0 or 0 on the morning. I tell them they can call me late though. Anyway, I need a cellular. Ah, I don't know what to do with PROPNAME. He wants to buy me a cell phone, a ring and send a dozen of roses to my house. I know that's sweet, but I don't like for guys to buy me things, especially not expensive stuff, but I do need a cell phone. I don't know. I miss PROPNAME. We were supposed to get married. He told me that he loved me and would never leave me or break up with me, but he did. He had our life planned out. He knew what kind of cars we were going to have, how many kids we were going to have and what our house was going to look like. I hate it, because I don't even know why we broke up. He gave me all of these excuses, but I knew they weren't true. I later found out, like a whole year later, that two stupid girls broke us up because they were jealous that we were together. They probably liked him and wanted him for themselves. That's another thing that bothers me. If it was because of a good reason, then I would understand, but they made him believe that I cheated on him. I loved him so much and would never have done that to him. I don't understand why he believed them anyway. If he had any doubts, he should've asked me if it was true instead of just believing them. \nAsnwer:"
