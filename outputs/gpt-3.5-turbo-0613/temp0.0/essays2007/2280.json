No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Okay dokey here we go. just thought I would get this assignment out of the way before I'm overloaded with other stuff. Or either put off until the last minute. I hate when I do that. Must not do that any more you know you can tell yourself that repeatedly but that doesn't mean that it is going to happen. My past shows oh well. Man my stomach hurts just got done eating a salad and now omg pain. Why is that these days it seems like my stomach can't handle anything without getting upset gross. Oh well listening to a new cd I got this weekend and I'm liking it. The band was really good live too ill just have to go out and see them again sometime. Omg this is a lot of writing for only 0 min. I feel bad for the people who are going to read all the students papers. 00minutes of writing never seemed like so much well. Now that I'm actually doing it I'm sure that there is going to be a few pages worth. Once for another LOCNAME experiment I had to do this too and it was hand written for 00min I much better prefer the typing (is that even proper English. Note to self again. Work on grammar) ohm well at the other LOCNAME experiment that I was doing. I was in high school and they put me in the back o f the library (never can spell that word) and told me to write about whatever it is we wanted for 00min. Well there I am sitting writing away thinking to myself wow I've been writing for a long time. Why haven't they called me up yet. But I never saw the start time. And sadly I ended up writing for 00min. That is a lot especially be hand. These days everyone it seems is so dependent on computers. Good at times bad at other. Only 00 minutes to go. This has to be by far the most enjoyable assignment I have received so far. I think I enjoy writing it seems to be relaxing. I think I shall start writing in a journal again. Although I only seem to write in my journal when I'm angry and htne lock it away until another god awful days comes along. Maybe I should start again but this time maybe daily or so. Everyone says it is a stress reliever. Ha-ha this cd is cute. The lyrics crack me up at times. He is talking about how the bank classifies him as \"poor\" because he doesn't have much money in the bank. And believe me I know how that feels. Grrrr I need to get some source of income. Seriously. Well my stomach is feeling better I wonder what the deal was. Omg today after class. Since I'm to stub run to wait for the bus I walked up the HUGE hill to c panking and today for the first time with a back-pack full of books!! OMG the walked own the hill doesn't compare to the walk up. I thought I was going to die ha-ha but I guess its a good work out plus the what 00pounds of books LOCNAME damn good work out. Man 0 minutes to go. Good thing this essay isn't graded on grammar or spelling because I think I am the worst speller (that doesn't even sound like the right word) in the world. But and English teacher of mine once told me that bad spelling is a sign of intelligence. Hahahaha ironic. He was a great teacher though I really miss his class. He had a way of making the (at the team high school) students look at the world with open eyes. More mature eyes . Ha-ha and he would through in dark humor every once in a while . Woke the class up. Great teacher. I've actually loved all my English teachers in high school although I am horrible at writing and reading. But their classes were challenging and fun. Everything else in school was to much of a breeze for me. Although NOW at LOCNAME I'm a little scared. I hope I can handle it. I think as long as I can make it past the first year I should be able to have the hang of it and do fine the next couple of years . Right ha-ha. You know what this assignment reminds me of. The new TV show THE DAYS. How the teenager dude sits in his room and writes in his journal ha-ha too cute. Didn't dugie houser (can't remember if that is his name or not) do the same thing. Aww poor guy since he was  a doc at such a young age. Don't you ever wonder if kids like that  miss out on their childhoods. I feel bad for them. Seeing ym younger bro and sis grow up hurts because now I know they are going to be exposed to the real world. And they will no longer have that innocence and purity as they once did. The real world is harsh. Man if I could be 00 again I sure would. Yet when I was 00 I remember wanting to be 00 and then wanting to be 00. And not that I'm turning 00. Ohm DEPRESSING. Last year to be a teenager. Although I never really did all the teenage stuff. It was all to immature for me. But soon I'm going to be 00 and that means. Reaching adult. You can't be called a kid anymore. All though I love to call people kid all the time its the greatest. people should call each other kid again maybe peoples outlook on life wouldn't be so scary. Well 00min up. I bet I look like I have ADD. prob. do. Ha-ha  \nAsnwer:"
