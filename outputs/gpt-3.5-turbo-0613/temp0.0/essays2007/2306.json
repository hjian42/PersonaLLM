No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have realized that my computer at home is a lot slower than my cool computer at school. I miss my computer at school, but at least this one does not have annoying pop-ups like that one. Ah! I am angry at PROPNAME for downloading a stupid program onto my computer that had hidden programs. I am at home right now and I am happy, I miss being able to shower without shower shoes on. Everything is a lot more clean too, at least that is how I feel. I think that that's just because I am used to home. Oh my god my typing skills have deteriorated I think so have my spelling skills my head itches and I just washed my hair so now its dripping all over my shirt, because I am too lazy to blow dry my hair. speaking of which I need to bring my blow dryer to school so I don't sleep with wet hair because that gives me headaches. Today on the bus back home I was feeling nauseous hmm I do not think I spelled that right because I was reading my psychology reading hehe that's what I'm writing this essay for anyways I was feeling like I you know having to capitalize all the It's is very annoying and my weird keyboard is not helping very much either o yah so I decided to take a nap so I would not throw up. I miss my house. I hope tomorrow I will be able to hang out with my old friends who are still at home! many of them have left already except the ones going to west coast schools. lucky people they are, except they will still be in school in June when all of us are out! I told daddy about the LOCNAME scholar program that I was interested in, but I knew that he was not going to let me go or really try to apply. I think that my parents are way to protective of me sometimes, but I know it is for my own good because oh! I might get in some accident over there and they will not be able to help me, but seriously, if I get into a really bad accident there should be people in LOCNAME who would help me by the way the LOCNAME scholar program is this thing where part of it you spend three weeks in LOCNAME going to old world war II sites and you learn about world war II, which I think is interesting partially because I seem to be weirdly interested in wars and stuff, maybe that's why I like PROPNAME's Game so much. but I also like band of brothers! which got me interested in world war II in the first place! and my favorite movie is black hawk down which is also kind of about a war, but more like a battle. I'm thinking about bringing my DVD's to school, but one they might not fit into my tiny suitcase and two they might distract me because I'll want to watch them instead of studying, like how my roommate and I stayed up until 0:00 for the past 0 nights watching Chinese soap operas. I think it's really funny because I am not really into girly stuff and the acting is so bad in these dramas but they sort of just suck you in and you have to finish watching them, like when you watch anime, speaking of which I need to see if the next Full Metal Alchemist episode is out or maybe I will just borrow it from my buddy. She's crazy but I like how she is protective of me. So I know that I hopefully won't get into any scary trouble! hehe it's like, now that I am away from my family at least I have someone I can trust to be there for me most of the time. I hope. I think. I don't know. maybe not that much. yea my hair is getting dry and now I have a piece of hair on my hand. I seem to be shedding a lot but I think that is normal because everyone else I have talked to say that it happens to them too. I just don't like how every time I wash my hair big wads of hair come out. I feel like I'm going bald, except I still have tons of hair, which makes me wonder how do I still have this much hair yet lose so much hair every time I wash my hair. because it takes a while for new hairs to grow as long as the old ones right? I wonder how much hair do we really have on our heads. I miss my sister and her friends this summer was really fun. even though I was only in LOCNAME for about a week I really felt like I belonged there. It just seems so hard to go out and meet new people. I think I'm too shy around strangers. If I acted like myself when I'm with friends around people I don't know maybe it will be easier to make new friends. but I am afraid that eek I think I feel that I have a headache coming on. but I feel that I'll scare people away. But I mean if I'm going to be their friend they will eventually find out that that's the way I am right? I guess yay only about three more minutes to go. I think  my contacts are getting kind of foggy. I should blink more. I wonder do hard contacts yah they do but I think they get more dry quicker than soft contacts. I think they might be dirty but wouldn't that make my eyes hurt? maybe I don't know I always cringe when they fall into the sink! ew so gross. and to think that I'm putting these into my eyes everyday! I forgot to bring my sucker thing home just incase my contacts got stuck in my eyes. But I guess it's okay because I hope guess think they won't get stuck. so I didn't really forget I just say I did. it's kind of like I'm like a pathological liar then? I don't know it's just easier to say things and not have to explain them because then people get bored and are like \"why are you telling me this\" so I just lie to make it easier. I wonder if that's bad? like I remember the time that my friend called me really late at night and wanted to talk for no apparent reason. now my time is up!  \nAsnwer:"
