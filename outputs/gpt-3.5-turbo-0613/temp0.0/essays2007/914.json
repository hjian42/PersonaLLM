    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: The way I feel has always been of interest to me. i have experienced so many emotions that at times my mind seem confused and bogged down with internal conflict. I have some what of a codependent personality and love to have relationships (longlasting perferably) with members of the opposite sex. To be completely honest, sex is usually not the primary motive for me in a relationship. Currently I feel somewhat lonely as all of my friends are currently in relationships that have been very beneficial to them. I live in an apartment which is not as advantageous as it seems. The people at Jester seem to be easily approached and my friends have met far more new people than I. I don't believe I am as happy about being in college for this reason. I love meeting new people. I find it hard to concentrate on work and am constantly thinking about certain people or friends I left behind. I seem to dwell on the past lately. I go on eating binges and then won't have an appetite for days to follow. I work out constantly and lately have been woried about my physical appearance. I many times dwell onthe question \"Why do I not have a girlfriend, why do they not find me attractive. \"  I guess part of the reason I feel this way is simply because as a child I was teased about being overweight. I guess I developed a level of self consciousness as a child and still to this day am woried about my weight. I've tried meeting people but the conventional means just do not seem to work for me. It is hard for me to approach a girl and that tends to bother me somewhat. Personally I tend to avoid large groups simply because id rather get acquainted with a person on a one on one basis. I also worry excessively about my grades. I guess from reading what I wrote my biggest feeling/emotion is lonliness. \nAsnwer:"
