No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well this is the first time that I have ever been told to write for twenty minutes straight about what is going on inside of my head. Anyways, yeah it is early in the morning and I just got back from calculus, and I am extremley tired. The reason that I am tired is because I did not get a lot of sleep this weekend. I really wanted to catch up on my sleep but it did not really happen. The reason for this is, that on Saturday night I did not go to bed until like four or five in the morning and then I needed to wake up semi-early to do some necessary homework. I really am a night person and I do not ever mind staying up late even when I have to wake up early the next morning. Well anyways, school has been its usual self. I am really enjoying the college life and the freedom from my parents, but I miss all of my friends so much. I really wish we had more vacation time so that I could spend it with my friends. The person that I miss the most, is of course my sister. We have grown up our whole lives together, and now that she is actually maturing and becoming a normal person, I am not there to see it and it is kind of sad. Anyways, also I miss PROPNAME a lot. I mean I realized how good of friends we were, but since we have both gone to college, I realize it even more. He is the one that can always put me in a good mood when I am upset. He can always make me feel so much better about myself. I can never get mad at the kid, even if he says the rudest things or the most inconciderate things. He is a great friend and someone that I will always want to be in touch with. I mean saturday night we talked on the phone for like four hours. I mean that is a lot of talking. I never thought I could talk on the phone that much, but with him the conversation is never boring, never worthless, never repetitive. It is always something new and great to hear. Yeah we have our moments where we say somethings to each other that normally if anyone else said that stuff we would get really angry, but we know that we really do not mean it, and that we are really good friends. Well enough about him, he already occupies enough of my time. Twenty minutes is a really long time to type, considering that the first time I did this my computer like froze or something when I pushed the finish button, which really made me mad. Well I also have this other friend named PROPNAME, whom I have known since like sixth grade and have like since sixth grade. He goes to school here and we hang out a lot, but he has a girlfriend in LOCNAME LOCNAME, whom I hear about every freakin day of my life. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. I really want to meet some more people. I have been here about two weeks and I have not really met that many people, which is kind of sad.  I am used to having a lot of friends and a lot of friends to do stuff with all the time, and for the first time in my life I do not have a lot of friends and it is kind of depressing. I mean I have no trouble meeting people or even talking to random strangers, but when it comes to really becoming someone friend I am having a harder time than I thought I would. I know that I just need to give it some more time, I can not expect to make everlasting friends within two weeks. I give out that advice to a lot of people, but I do not ever really listen to the advicec myself. Wow, I have like seven minutes left and my left hand is really starting to cramp up and it is getting harder and harder to type as each secong passes. I really wish that this would just end. When you are told to type about what is going on inside your head, you really have trouble. I usually do not have any trouble telling people about things I think about. . Oh my gosh this is so random, but last night around four in the morning or something like that, I woke up with a major cramp in my left calf. It hurt so incredibly bad. I tried walking, but I couldn't. It hurt so bad that I was crying until it went away. Even though it only lasted a short period of time, the time that it did last was torturous. Anyways, back to the analization of how I can not write when someone tells me too. I really wonder how people can take what a person writes and interpret it to mean something totally random. I just find that absolutely bizzare. I do not think that I would ever have that ability. I have two meetingts to go to tonight, and I do not know how I am going to do this, because they are both at the same times. Yay I am getting excited because I only have like two and a half minutes left to go. This really shows you how long twenty minutes is. I always thought that it was a really short time, but when you have to do something like this where you watch the time tick by, you are able to see that twenty minutes is a real long time. I really do not like Mondays and Wednesdays. I do not like the fact that I have classes in the morning and then I have a huge break, and then I have classes in the afternoon. We had open door night last night, and our room won cutest runner up. I do not know who won cutest overall, but we were happy with what we got. It is finally about to come to and end and my hands are in a lot of pain and will be relieved when they do not have to type anymore. Well less than thirty seconds and it is all over. I am way pumped over here.  \nAsnwer:"
