I need to read and take note for all my classes. The bird is really getting on my nerves. I hope I will be able to finish all of my homework in time. If I write my paper at home I can print it at my sister's house, but I would have to finish it before I go home because I do not want to do it this weekend. I would ask someone to print it for me but I do not have enough time to go in the morning. I wonder what the psychology test is going to be like. I can't wait to go home. I miss my nephew so much and he is growing so fast. I miss my mom and dad. I hope my dad is o. k. The doctors can't do anything anymore and I am very worried about him. I do not have to do laundry today and the apartment is going to quiet if I do not put the television on. I am going to try to work all day without the television. Once as I turn it on it will never be turned off and I need to study. I really enjoy my days off. Too bad this is the last time I get to sleep late and not have to go anywhere. I would not be able to go anywhere since I do not have a car and I can't drive a standard. I want my own car, a ORGNAME Bug that is midnight blue. My aunt has one and it is so big and has lots of space. It is the perfect car for me because I do not like huge cars. Big cars seem to take control over you and I like to be able to control the car. I also want it to be an automatic because I do not know how to drive a stick shift. It would also be so much easier with an automatic. \nAsnwer:"
