No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: It feels like more time has passed and that my life has been turned upside down. Not too badly upside down, but it is definitely different. I had friends come home this weekend and I loved seeing them, but I also realized that college is different for all of us. I noticed changes in my friends that didn't affect our friendships but nonetheless were there. I loved having friends home, knowing I had people to go out with and overall just having a blast. But- it just reinforced the distance between us once they left. I love college and all the new people I've met- I just haven't had the time yet to make the kind of friends I had in high school. I understand this, but it's frustrating to go from always having 00 people to call and talk to down to maybe 0 or 0. I met some people at the Longhorn game on Saturday and it was awesome!  I just hope that that will keep occurring and soon enough I will have those close friendships with people in college. My friends and I also talked for quite a while last night about one of our friends who went to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I've realized that I miss him but at the same time have mixed feelings about that sense of loss. In so many ways I wish he were here but I know that wouldn't be right. It doesn't make it any easier, just a little bit more complicated. I'm also trying to get over my frustration of living at home this year. I feel like out of 00,000 students, I am the only one staying at home with my parents. In so many ways it's not too bad, but when I go out with friends and they can do whatever, come home whenever and so on it makes me realize how much freedom I'm missing out on. A lot of it is that I am sad that I don't have the advantage of meeting people in a dorm and making new friends that way. It's also hard because so many of the people I am friends with are all living on campus and so it's a lot easier for them to get together than it is for me to get together with them. Anytime I have to come up to campus it's at least 00 minutes and a hard time finding a parking place. It just sucks because that's really the only thing I don't like about my college experience so far. It always makes me laugh when they talk about the freedom from your parents that college brings because I don't have that. This is an awful long time to write. I don't really know what else I have floating around in my head and I still have 00 minutes. School work is starting to kind of scare me. It's like oh I have a test in 0 weeks so I don't need to worry about it now and then I know that all of a sudden 0 weeks are going to have passed and I'm not going to be prepared. I love not going to all of my classes everyday. It makes it seem less difficult. The one thing that really sucks about my schedule is the fact that I have these huge breaks between classes. On Wednesdays and Mondays I have 0 hours between classes and 0. 0 between 0 others. The worst part is that I don't know what to do with the time and I can't go to my dorm because I don't have one. I'm starting to hope that the next writing assignment isn't to explain your feelings about college because that's what I've done in this one so I might be stuck at the computer for awhile next time. I'm listening to the Titanic soundtrack right now. I've been listening to it a lot lately. I think it's because it's pretty relaxing and it calms me down. The music is beautiful and it makes me think of the movie. I went to see Titanic twice. The first time the movie cut off in the last part of the movie. It totally ruined the effect and it really sucked because they turned all the lights on and well, you can just imagine. 0 more minutes. I'm really glad that I didn't have to work today. I feel sorry for the people who did have to go up to work on our first school holiday. I work up at the recreation center on campus and I love it. The people there are really cool and now there are some people who are my age. This summer when I worked there, there was no one under the age of 00 except for me. It made it kind of weird because they were all in a stage of life that I had no idea about and won't for at least another 0 years. One of my friends from high school works there and I like having her there. I hate the fact that we don't work together, but hey that's the way life goes. I wish I had more hours simply because that would be something for me to do with my down time on campus. Two more minutes. I never realized how long 00 minutes could be. I've found email to be quite handy with friends because I can email my side of a conversation in about 0 minutes instead of having to go through the pain of writing a letter, putting it into the mail and sending it. I have no mailbox so it makes it even more difficult to mail a letter because I have to go all the way to the post office. Whoever thought of neighborhood community mailboxes with no drop box for outgoing mail needs to be laid off of his or her job. Well looks like my time here is done. I guess I have one more to do but not until tomorrow. \nAsnwer:"
