No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Right now I am feeling a sense that I have a lot of catching up to do in my reading. Not particularly for this subject but for some of my others. my classes thid semester consist of a lot of reading. For the most part I am enjoying school. I think that it will only get better as days go by and I begin to meet more and more people. I am from LOCNAME and hardly any of my friends came to UT. I guess that they all wanted to get away from home. I love LOCNAME and ORGNAME has a wonderful Interior Design program, it is in the school of Architecture. Right now I am in the Arch. library and my typing is kind of loud I hope that it is not bothering anyone. I am about to go to my next class it is an architecture  class with 000 students. Most of my classes except for one are with 000 students. (about 000)  College goes by so quickly I can't believe that it is already thursday. Where does the time go?  Since I am from LOCNAME I have learned that living in austin and attending school in austin are totally different. I am the only family member besides my grandmother who decided to come to LOCNAME. most of my family went to ORGNAME ORGNAME, ORGNAME, and ORGNAME. My sister just graduated college from colorado state in Ft. PROPNAME. I love LOCNAME. My older brother is going to grad school at Ut LOCNAME and working at the same time.  Over the Christmas holiday my sister and I are going to LOCNAME, PROPNAME, I can't wait. Well there is so much I could say right now but I am running out of time. Sorry for all of the mistakes. \nAsnwer:"
