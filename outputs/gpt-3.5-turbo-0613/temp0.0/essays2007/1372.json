Does that mean I have some kind of psychoanalytical problem? I don't know about complexes and childhood mistakes but I do know that there is really something disturbingly lazy about my attitude towards things. What kind of person could put his entire future on the line by not taking care of his college responsibilities? I am that kind of person. I'll probably drop out of college or something and what's even worse is that I see the problem staring me right in my face but I am either to lazy or to apathetic to change my situation. Maybe I am a combination of both. Honestly, what will my parents say? Well, my Dad will probably be relieved that I came back home to him. Not in the way most families would be relieved though. He would just have another speech to hang over my head after every other mistake I may make in the future. He will probably totally dominate on me like he used to back in the day. He literally did not care about how you felt. Maybe that is not quite accurate. I am convinced that he cared about people, and he cared about the family structure as a whole, however his total control over everyone in the house was clear and unbinding. He probably would have defended us with his life, I am sure of it. It is ironic; he would die for us but he wouldn't compromise with us to save his life. Compromise? Never! God forbid! I know it cannot be that hard to prioritize. Wait a minute. How funny is that? I of all people have no business trying to tell someone to prioritize especially when it will be a God sent miracle if I turn in all my assignments this semester. But maybe, just maybe I have stumbled on to something here. I mean, well, what is the point I am trying to make? Maybe I recognize similarities between my persona and the people I have associated myself with over the years. Duh that's a no brainer. But it is interesting the way one can tell. With my friends it is very, very easy to see that we all talk and act and think alike. Sometimes we deliberately change ourselves to fit the mold. With people you dislike it is very different though isn't it? It seems that what we see in them we hardly see at all. I can feel, if almost by instinct, that he and I have some very serious related issues, however one doesn't just stumble over them in his summation of the days events. A person has to be writing on a day very much like today, working on an assignment, very much like this one, following his \"stream of consciousness. \" Whatever that means is almost beside the point as far as I am concerned. Maybe this is like a journal or something. Maybe I should start writing a journal or something. I can be like \"Captain PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME\" writing his \"captains log. \" Wow. How did I get so off track? All I know is that I started this thing at twelve sixteenpm which means that in another minute I will be able to stop writing about my pitiful mental concepts. I'll probably drop off in mid sentence or something \nAsnwer:"
