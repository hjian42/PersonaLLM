No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: After my first week at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, my mind is filled with a mixture of thoughts and emotions. On one hand, I am excited about starting at a new school and the opportunities that await me. However, I also worry whether I'll be able to balance the social aspect of my life with the challenges of school. First and foremost in my mind presently is pledgeship, which is drawing constantly nearer. What am I going to have to do? How am I going to be able to stay at the house all night and do others' chores and keep a good GPA? It will surely be difficult, but I am fairly confident I can do it. I have always been successful at overcoming challenges in my life. The hardships of pledgeship combined with the rigors of being in the business honors program should make for a busy semester, to say the least. I feel a great amount of pressure to perform. I have to make at least a 0. 0 to stay in the ORGNAME, and 0. 00 to keep my scholarship money. This is the root of the nervous feelings within me. There is also a great deal to be excited about this semester also. I am excited about the experiences I will have, the people I will meet, and the friends I will make. This semester will be unlike any other I've had in my life. Thinking of the times I've had in the past 0 days since I arrived here makes me certain I chose a great school to attend. The ORGNAME will offer me incredible future opportunities, and the friendships I forge with my pledge brothers will last a lifetime. I still can't believe that I'm already in college and moved away from home. I will face a great number of challenges this semester, but I am excited about them and overcoming these challenges will make this semester all the more rewarding. \nAsnwer:"
