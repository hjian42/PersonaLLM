I have to call about volunteering and for sure email PROPNAME to see if they have a Physical Therapy program at her hospital. How will I get this stuff done. I am torn as to whether or not to join a Fraternity. I think I will, I just hope I have time to get my studies done. As well as time to myself. I really need to get my bike back from PROPNAME's apartment. I'm sure it's getting to be a bit cumbersome there. Sometime tomorrow I have to find a way to get to the mall and buy some clothes. I need 0 ties, a new pair of khaki pants, some dress shoes and other miscellaneous things. I am so glad I changed my class schedule. It will be so much better this way. I am so stressed out about physics. I so hope I at least make a \"B\" in there. Pray, oh pray. I should make it to the ORGNAME Thursday evening and check that out. I am sure there are some good looking ladies there. I can't believe the Horns lost. What the heck?  To N. c. State. They better come back and win this week against ORGNAME. Actually we need PROPNAME back. Another thing is I need to wash my car. It's pitiful!  Definitely get the golf clubs out of my car. Or at least relocate them to a more convienient place. I seriously hope things go well with the Fraternity. I mean that is a lot of $$$. Campus looks nice tonite. I love the tower. I think I like college football way better than pro. It has so much more of an aura to it. The pros don't have any spirit. The college game is where it's at. I wonder where my roomate is. That punk never tells me when he's leaving. I still have to do the pretest. I tried, but it gave me some gateway server error message. I need to make sure and read for History and Government. I hope this Thursday schedule is going to work. I am starting to get a hint of missing my friends, but nothing like I thought it was going to be. Actually pretty good. Oh man, I just got an Instant Message. Oh well, I really need to finish this assignment. I kind of like this. Let's me get my feelings out. I need to find a Church for sure. I haven't been reading my Bible like I should since I got to Austin. I really need to work on that. I wonder what the rest of the year is going to be like. This move from a ORGNAME college is a bit extreme. Nothing like high school to college, but I went from a college with  0,000, to a college of 00,000. I probably have met 000 people so far. I am so terrible with names. I really need to work on that. My suite mates are being loud. Makes me not want to study. Or at least go elsewhere. I should probably check out the UGL or PCL anyway. I bet I could do a better job there in the first place. So what am I going to do this weekend?  It being Labor Day, I kind of have a choice. I might go to LOCNAME to visit my Sister or might stay and go to the lake with  PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I really miss my folks. Way more than I expected. I hope I get over it soon. I need to email some people and say hi before too much longer. I wonder what my new Physics prof is going to be like?  Good or Bad?  Nice or Unpleasant?  What?  I need to start praying more. Maybe that will help me with my confidence and focus. Whatever happens, I need to call PROPNAME tonite and line everything up for tomorrow night. This class schedule is going to be so much easier!  I love it!  No Friday school!  Three day weekends for a whole semester. I hope my ORGNAME classes aren't too strenuous all together. This is my first time to really balance 0 classes like that. \nAsnwer:"
