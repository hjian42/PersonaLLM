I need to go get ready for track, but I would really  like to sit down and relax. perhaps go outside and sit by the pool and  catch some rays. I c0ompletly failed my music quiz. I wish I could have  prepared better. I  have been running around and it would feel so nice to just sit down and relax. What am I writing about. This seems so odd to  'sit here and write what I am thinking. I feel like  I should be trying to  keep my typing neat. and worry about spelling/grammar. Oh well. I am very sore. I wish that I didn't work out so hard because now I'm  paying for it. I really need to go read my kinesiology work. I wonder if  the person who reads this what she thinks, She must get so many strange responses. I hope this goes through the email system in time. I have  random thoughts. I guess everyone's thoughts are random. I wonder How PROPNAME is doing. I really need to call her but I don't have the m money for this month to spend on more long distance calls. It's so weird being away from dad and mom. I almost miss the nagging, but I guess  PROPNAME's taking their place. She really mad me mad last night. I wish she would be more considerate when getting dressed in the morning and ready for bed at night. The boyfriend thing is getting out of hand. Why doe's so someone want to go around and tell people that her boyfriend is psychotic? I hope PROPNAME's roommate mobes out so that I can talk about mobing in with PROPNAME at the end of the semester, but I feel bad leaving PROPNAME, but if she is going to be this much of a perfectionist and somewhat inconsiderate I have to look out for myself. I hope PROPNAME is doing well with his Steave  situation. I know that I could help him out, but I don't want to be the know it all little sister. PROPNAME is so sweet and I don\u2019t' want PROPNAME to  push him around. I think I've been writhing for a long time yep, it's been 00 min. bye. \nAsnwer:"
