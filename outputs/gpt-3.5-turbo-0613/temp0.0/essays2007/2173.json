No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: This is my first year at ORGNAME ORGNAME, and I feel nervous and confused about what is to come. I am not accustomed to all this work and it is really making me worried because I cannot keep up in all my classes. For one, I have so much to do in all my classes, and two, I live off-campus and it takes at least an hour to get back to my apartment. My roommates a complete slob and he leaves his stuff everywhere around the house; just yesterday I notice he is been eating out of some fried chicken that was left over from last saturday and has been sitting out on the counter for 0 days!             I also want to keep up with my friends, but it is so hard because there is so much work. They're always asking me to go party with them on the weekends, but that is not something that I like to do. I don't drink and I don't plan on to and I am not interested in meeting girls because I am currently happy in my relationship. I've been going out with her for 00 months and one day. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me; sometimes I feel as if she cares for me then I care for myself. I've never felt like this before, specially with a member of the opposite sex. I don't have good looks to attract girls, but from what people tell me, I have a good personality. I listen to what others have to say. I listen to their problems and try to help them with their problems - I am not just saying this to suck up to a psychology professor, but I really do this. I am majoring in psychology; it is what I really want to do. Back to my girlfriend, she is currently going to ORGNAME and will be transferring to LOCNAME next year. What really bugs me though is how whenever I go to see her, my friends are always bugging me about Hey man, are you going to smash her?\" and my answer is \"NO. \" You can call me old-fashioned but I believe in abstinence. I am a virgin. It bugs others, but it doesn't bug me. I don't get how people can make love to multiple girls and not feel dirty about it. I know I would. I would never have sex with my girlfriend before we get married. I want to have that respect for her and just restrain myself from that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love her. I want to make love to her, but I am not going to. I have morals. I was raised in a culture where dating was frowned upon. My parents had no problems with it as long as I didn't do anything - and I don't. I really like this girl, and I have thought of a future with her in the long run and I do not want to compromise that. I just wish that she would be here with me. As you can see, she means a lot to me and she is on my mind a lot. My major is psychology, but eventually I want to become a pediatrician or maybe even a psychiatrist - I don't know yet. It worries me that I will have to stay in school for another 0 years and that is a real long time but I feel that it is worth it, so I do not want to give up. I will try my best. Now I am sitting here not knowing how to word this paper because I am so accustomed to High School writing with 0 paragraphs and an introductory and conclusion, but the assignment was to simply state my feelings - so I am. It is raining outside right now. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I have classes. It would not be fun walking drenched to philosophy 000 with Professor PROPNAME. Philosophy also seems like an interesting class for me. Professor PROPNAME is hilarious and is awesome to listen to (as you are). The rats with altered hypothalamuses were hilarious and they really made me think about all the technology that is out there. I know I am doing the right thing by taking all the classes I am to pursue my career. I am scared that my grades won't be able to cut it though. All these classes require a lot of reading, and reading isn't exactly my best subject. I am trying my best to keep up and continue with all the reading and continue with turning in my assignments on time. It is really hard but I think I should be all right. I am especially worried about this class, because the lectures are completely different from the textbook and I have to keep up on both and well - I am just a confused little man. My times running out and my brain is struggling to squeeze words out to finish up this assignment. I also have a chemistry exam tomorrow. YES tomorrow. So hopefully I'll do good at that because it seems relatively easy. I miss my parents. They are back in LOCNAME. They don't want me to go visit them because they don't want me adding mileage to the car. So I am stuck in  LOCNAME til Thanksgiving. I'll go home, eat turkey, and come back sick. Yes, I do listen in class. \nAsnwer:"
