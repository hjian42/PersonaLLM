    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I just had a conversation with PROPNAME. She can be so touchy sometimes. It seems as though she is so insecure with herself that she can't stand it when someone says something that is contrary to what she is saying. Just a few minutes before hand, I was telling her about what I need to for this writing assignment and she said that she often writes stream of consciousness\" writings and gave me an example where she a friend of hers wanted some advice on a story he was writing and in affect, she gave him a story that was just following her thoughts and that wasn't pre-planned. I told her that that was not \"stream-of consciousness\" because she was focusing her mind on a particular theme or plot to come up with a story. Then she just got irritated and told me that I don't do that to her. And I was like, \"What?\". She doesn't make any sense. Oh dear. LOCNAME is screaming her head off and I have to cover her so she can go to sleep tonight. It is 00:00 and she usually starts screaming about now. LOCNAME is a nice bird though, other than the screaming when she is in a demanding mood. She usually keeps herself pretty entertained. There she goes again. I should tell monica to cover her. PROPNAME is probably busy with her studies. How am I supposed to tend to my bird while I am doing this assignment? I have to stay here and complete it or then I wouldn't really be doing the assignment right. That brings up another point. What is someone really has to go to the bathroom during these 00 minutes. Are they supposed to just sit here and risk getting a bladder infection so they may do well on this assignment? Would that be cheating if someone took a bathroom break? Ok, I had to go cover the cage but it didn't take more than five seconds(literally) because the cage is on the other side of the room that I am in. That is a relief. Now she isn't screaming. Now what should I write about. Hmmm. I had a yoga class today. ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was very difficult to do and very fun. I hope to become really flexible this semester. I also have a really good workout schedule planned for this semester. I got a texercise pass from Gregory gym for 00 dollars and I have access to all these cool aerobics classes and yoga classes. It is wonderful. I just wish I didn't have this psychology class at 0:00 to 0pm because two really good classes go on at that time. It is really disappointing. I can't believe I am taking a psychology class(000) this late into my undergrad. I am a senior and I am just taking this class because I decided just recently I want to go into Counseling Psychology. And in order to do that I need 0 Psychology classes with a \"B\" or higher. I am going to make an A in this class. This summer had a large effect on me. I realized that I really didn't want to become a professor and be consumed by grading papers and research and not have adequate time with my family. I think I just spelled that \"adequate\" word incorrectly. I hope this assignment isn't going to be graded on spelling. That would be ridiculous because this is a \"stream of consciousness\" paper. What if a persons stream of consciousness is going insane and causing the person to type faster than normal to get every thought down and in the process spell words incorrectly. This page doesn't have a spell checker. People are so spoiled by spell checkers and typing. Have you noticed that everyone has bad handwriting these days because no one really needs to master the art of writing? My sister told me that when she was little she used to practice her handwriting all the time so it would look nice when she would have to write papers. That seems so ancient now and that was only about 00 or 00 years ago. Its crazy how technology has progressed so rapidly within the past few years. What is going to happen next? I will tell what will happen next. We will overpopulate to the point where there will be no trees or animals left. The earth will be polluted and humans will be the cause of their own demise. I think they should study that in psychology. Why are humans the only animal that makes its environment adapt to it rather than it adapt to its surroundings? We are the only animal that is ruining earth and eating up all its resources. We are causing a great imbalance in nature. Would they even be able to study that in psychology? That might be a little taboo because everyone is so full of themselves that they don't want to admit how ridiculous humans are. or rather, can be. I really like sociology and anthropology better than psychology. Or at least I have more experience in those other two areas. I tend to take the middle ground however. I am not like a psychologist saying that a lot of aspects of human behavior is biological and I am not like a sociologist saying that every aspect of human behavior is a product of environment. I think it is a combination of both and it seems like to me that both fields are too extremist. Am I going to get a bad grade for badmouthing psychology? I hope not. Psychology is a good field, don't get me wrong, but one has to remember that everything has its faults. I took that horrible pre-test today for the experiments. Some of the questions were funny to me. I think its great that they want to know how interested a person is in erotica. Haha. My 00 minutes are over. Guess you don't get to read about my opinions on erotica. \nAsnwer:"
