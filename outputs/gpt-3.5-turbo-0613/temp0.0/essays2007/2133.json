No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME and I am getting ready to write everything that crosses my mind within the next 00 minutes. Right now I'm thing about all the reading I have to do for my classes and what am I supposed to do with myself since I don't have a Psychology book. The book won't be coming in until Monday. I believe in God so I now that he will make a way for me to get my hands on a Psychology Book. What tv show comes on tonight and how long is this scholarship dinner going to be. Why does the Rugrats tv show come on in the middle of the day. What is my sister up to today? When is their next Battle of The Bands? My back hurts from typing so awkwardly. It's only been 0 minutes. It seems like I've typed everything I can think about. The lunch was pretty good I had I just wonder was it too fattening. I need to call the football trainer and see if I can get in touch with him. I need to start making connections now as a freshman if I want to accomplish my goals. HHMMMMmMMMm. I don't think the new Romeo show will be any good. I need to go and practice the piano since I haven't practiced since I left home. I need to find an organization that's perfect for me and I think the ORGNAME ORGNAME is perfect. HMMMMMMM. I've never met the professor yet and I really have no idea what this class is going to be about. It seems like it could be interesting though. I'm glad I made the decision to come to ORGNAME. I feel like I've made a major change with myself. Spiritually, socially, and physically. I've grown up with black people my entire life. At first I thought that it was going to be a total culture shock, but I shocked myself when I found out it's pretty cool to meet people other than your own race. I enjoy being with my people and all, but sometimes in life you have to step out and do something for yourself. If I had a went to a school with most of the people I already knew I probably wouldn't make any new friends which isn't good. I need to get a job when I get back to LOCNAME. What time is it. What time does my Psychology class begin. It begins at 0:00 so I still have plenty of time. Let me put my folder into my bag so that I won't leave it here. Boy I sure don't feel like walking to class in this heat. PROPNAME hall is too far away. I know that it's good exercise and all, but I just don't feel like walking. I don't see how people can stand to live in LOCNAME. There is nothing here to do, but go to school. At least I haven't seen anything here that would make me want to live here. I need to turn the tv volume down a little so that I can really think. I'm going to work out today. It feels good to work out. My roommate is probably wondering what am I still doing typing on the computer because I have been on the computer for almost and hour and I've been typing for almost 00 minutes straight with slight hesitation. So what is Prof PROPNAME going to do with all these thoughts when he reads them. My head is itching and it is too cold up in this building. \nAsnwer:"
