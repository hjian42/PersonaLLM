No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am at work right now but I don\u2019t start to work until about 00 more minutes I wonder if any one is  going to if anyone is going to ask me what I am doing oh well there is this person that I think is real nice so I cant really how does this thing work any way why won't it go to the next line by itself so I guess ill start to press enter when I cant see the words I am typing  I feel like laughing I don\u2019t really know why well I do but it would be  to dangerous for me to type them down. so one might see I wish I could go  home I just found out that my botany class test are short answers great. I still like the class though  cant wait fort he day to be over. I is supposed to rain today I want it to but I don't want to walk home or any where in this assignment is kind of hard I cant type as quick as my mind thinks I'm not sure I like this computer either well I\u2019m still skipping my thoughts  on the next assignment I think I better write it down instead. ok the truth  I did erase something from the beginning of this document. I\u2019m at work for goodness sakes. why do I keep putting periods down I guess it is hard to  write with out using punctuation also his voice sounds wonderful ok I've got to stop that oh well I didn\u2019t know that the top lines of the document eventually go up that a good thing she smiled at me probably wondering what I was doing I wish I had more time to write some more poems I will though I really want to perfect the one I wrote about the tanut this I going to look crazy when they print it out. I like this assignment though I never did ask if it was ok for me to be doing homework on the computers at work but mine at home is not fast enough to or doesn\u2019t have enough speed to get everything on the net on  my computer I rally want to  buy some more software for it but I don\u2019t know if I can afford it so this guy that I was telling you about is so fine I feel like I want to jump his bones I even had a dream about him last night nothing nasty though it wasn\u2019t even sexual so I wonder if they are going to see how many times a guy verses a girl brings up the topic of sex in their writings I hope my TA gets all of this information. anyway he's so sexy I have a boy friend thought it will be five years in November I don\u2019t believe it I love him though ok my mind has gone blank I cant think of anything I wish that when I write paper that the information I need to write him would flow a quickly as it is right now that would be cool so I could write a complete 00 page paper in one day I guess I would procrastinate one time though come to think of it yesterday I should have been writing my thoughts down I actually because aware became aware of what I was thinking it was kind of weird why to I keep trying to correct my mistakes maybe so it will be easier for the readier to follow I bet they are going to be having a grand time reading this class assignment I wonder what they are looking for. any way it would probably mess up the study if I did know. naked why I don\u2019t know so one to the next topic my the way I wasn\u2019t taking bout the Winston cigarette ads you know I don't smoke anyway well two more minutes until I have the file away my life at least to you its a play on words because it is part of the job description that I do I won't be doing it for the rest of my life though I do know that for sure actually I\u2019m not sure I know what I want to do bye. 't be doing it for                            \nAsnwer:"
