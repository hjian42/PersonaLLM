The pickle in it is a little too zesty, though. I don't think I'll buy those from ORGNAME anymore. I wish I had more time to watch TV. I really miss Big Brother 0, but I really can't find enough hours in the day. It makes me sad :(  I have a latin quiz on Friday, I don't know how well I'm going to do. I have flashcards for the vocabulary words, and they seem to be helping, so I think I'm going to go back and make flashcards for all of the paradigms. That's the hard part!  The paradigms aren't very different than spanish, but they are. I get them confused sometimes. I'm upset that I went to College Station this weekend and missed church. I really wanted to go this Sunday, but instead I went to Mass with my friend at College Station. I had fun in CS, and I definitely didn't want to stay here with my roommate, but I would have rather been back for the service. Oh well, I can go on Sunday. I start my job tomorrow!!  I'm kind of nervous about that. I've never had a job before. What if I really screw up??  And what if I'm not able to get from my job to my classes on time?  On Tuesday and Thursday, I'll have no problem, but what about Friday?  I work from 0-0, and I have a class at one. on the other side of the campus. I wish I would have just told her that I'd like to go into work an hour earlier on Thursday and then I could get out of work an hour earlier on Friday morning. That would have been perfect. But oh, well. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. . I took the pretest for the psych experiments and it seemed like it took forever!!  I didn't think I'd ever finish it. I've only been typing for 0 minutes!!  00 more to go, lol. Does anyone actually read these things?  Like, is it ok if I stop typing for a couple of seconds to take a bit of my sandwich?  I think I'm going to, hold on. . YUMMY!!  It's good, but those darn pickles. . Oh well. what exactly are we supposed to talk about. What we see?  Or feel? or smell? or whatever. Well, I'll tell you what I see. . WAIT!  No, I'll describe my side of the room for you: on my closet door I have a movie poster of PROPNAME PROPNAME's movie   Zoolander  . It has a great big, lime green Z on it and has Zoolander written at tht bottom in purple letters. It also has PROPNAME PROPNAME sitting kind of funny (I'm not sure how to explain it) in front of the Z. At the top it says 0% Body fat, 0% brain activity. I've never seen Zoolander, have you?  I just liked the poster because I thought it was funny. Beside it, I have a movie poster of LOCNAME LOCNAME. It has PROPNAME PROPNAME on it with oranges for eyes, and PROPNAME PROPNAME has an orange in his mouth. PROPNAME PROPNAME is gross. . all he did the whole movie was run around in his underwear. 00 minutes up!  Halfway done. Ok, back to my posters. The next poster I have is of PROPNAME PROPNAME in Breakfast at ORGNAME's, my favorite movie ever. She's wearing the black dress that she wears at the beginning when she's looking at ORGNAME's in the morning. Remember that dress?  She also has one of those looooong cigarette things, I'm not sure what it's called. *sigh* every girl should watch Breakfast at ORGNAME's. It's the best. Another poster I have is of Rat Race. Everyone on the poster has big heads and little bodies. On the poster there's: I think his name is PROPNAME PROPNAME, he was on Clueless, too. There's also PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, some guy who's name I don't know and can't relate another movie to him, LOCNAME LOCNAME, Jr. , PROPNAME PROPNAME, and the guy who keeps falling asleep throughout the movie. He's my favorite.   I'm win-ning!    It's so funny!  Ok, I also have an ORGNAME's Eleven poster. It's read with white writing on it. In the front are the hotties PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, and PROPNAME PROPNAME, and in the back kind of faded out are the rest of their little helpers from the movie. Beneath the title of the poster (ORGNAME's Eleven, hehe) It says   They're having so much fun it's illegal.   I think this is my favorite poster in my whole room. I also have a Spy Game poster on it. The only person on it is PROPNAME PROPNAME, and it says   It's not how you play the game. it's how the game plays you.   Very cool. What else?  Oh!  I also have a little picture, that is once again from Breakfast at ORGNAME's. It has both PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME looking in the window at ORGNAME's. She's wearing the same dress that she's wearing in my big poster and PROPNAME is wearing a coat and pants, with a skinny tie. He has his hands in his pocket and is laughing abut something silly that PROPNAME PROPNAME has said. At least, that is what I assume. I have been typing for 00 minutes and 00 seconds so that leaves me about 0 minutes left. Hmmm. . what else can be said. I have to save some describing for later, I don't want to give it all away in this first time. What will I talk about next time?  Are there ever going to be subjects for you to talk about, or will it always be like a mad journal thing?  I understand this mad journal thing, though, because what if you gave me a subject that I didn't really have much to say about. What would I say then??  So, I guess this is good, just mad journaling. . I'll think about what to say more next time, so I'll be a little more prepared and won't bore you out of your mind. 00 min. 00 seconds. . 0minute and some odd seconds left. 00 min!! woo-hoo. ok one more minute. What about this war ORGNAME wants to have with LOCNAME??  Is he nuts!  That'll be 0 wars (or at least fights) that we've had while he was president. How sad. 00 seconds left. what to say, what to say. . 00 seconds. Well, I'll start my good=byes now. Goodbye!! \nAsnwer:"
