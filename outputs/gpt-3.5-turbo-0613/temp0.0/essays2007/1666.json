No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      I wish travis would stop switching channels on the TV. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at LOCNAME. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. So in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. For a 00 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 00 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature?  i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like   kendra im gay   and i'll be like   i know its about time    and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of ORGNAME. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think its mostly because i was an only child when i was learning to read and my brother always had me getting in the way of his   alone time   with mom. but luckily for him he gets all the alone time with her that he can handle and he's in high school too. i think its just too funny. now mom's retired and always home and while i used to be jealous of the time they spent together -her always helping with his homework she would always go to his class parties and such - now she follows him around just so she won't get bored. i mean i know how often she calls me just to make sure i've been locking the doors before i go to sleep. i almost feel bad for him. almost. except he gets more parental funding still being at home and never having a job. i never asked for money like he does. i can't understand where his money goes either. he doesn't go anywhere he can't drive. but still he has no money. other than food i don't know where it goes i think he just puts it in a shoe box until he can afford a video \nAsnwer:"
