No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am a bit in wonderous as to what is supposed to be accomplished by this writing assignment and what it is supposed to prove. I hope this isn't some wierd psychoanalysis of who I am or something like that. Not that I am an X-files junkie and I think this is one big conspiracy or anything though. That is not one of the best shows about conspiracies anyway. I really enjoyed \"Conspiracy Theory\"  with mel PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME though. Right now I am thinking that I could be doing other homework that is a little bit more consequential for my classes tomorrow and just start typing random letters with little regard to this assignment, but I am an honest and will continue to do this assignment as if someone were really going to read it. I am really excited about the ORGNAME victory tonight over the ORGNAME, because it put us 0 games ahead of the reds who split their double header today. If the ORGNAME end up in the playoffs I plan on making at least one trip to LOCNAME to watch them play in the LOCNAME. Especially since that will probably be the last time I will khave a chance to see a game played in the LOCNAME. After this season they will be p;laying in their new stadium by the convention center. I think the convention center is a bit of a waste since LOCNAME doesn't seem to land many consequential national level events there. But that's LOCNAME for  you'. They never seem to get the kind of national coverage that LOCNAME LOCNAME or la gets. I guess that is because it is considerably smaller, but still. I think it has to do with LOCNAME being a bit excluded from the rest of the country. And with the lack of national events and tourism people will continue to think LOCNAME is all about cowboys and cattle wtith a few oil ranchers thrown in th e mix. \nAsnwer:"
