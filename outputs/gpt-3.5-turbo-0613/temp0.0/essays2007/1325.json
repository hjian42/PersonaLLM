No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: It may be tough to come up with an abundance ORGNAME ideas this morning, because I am fairly tired due to lack of sleep. Even though my first class today is not until two o'clock, I woke up early, not a brilliant decision on my part, and I am regretting it as we speak. However, I assume that I will feel alright once I venture outside into the sun and the sweltering heat that has overwhelmed LOCNAME for the past several months. I hope the twenty minutes that I am required to write for pass by in a hurry, because I have yet to finish some of my Economics homework that is due in class today. I have yet to discern whether my Economics professor is adequate in his teachings. On several occasions, he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics. On the other hand, my Calculus II teacher is not my favorite, because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor English. I am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures. Aside from these two exceptions, my professors appear after two weeks to be very adept in their teaching methods and are very entertaining and informative to listen to. I am tired of talking about school, because it seems like that is the only thing I came to Austin for. On many occasions so far I have gone out on nights that I wouldn't normally party on and have had a blast on good old Sixth Street. I think it helps a lot that a bunch of my friends from high school decided on the ORGNAME of ORGNAME as their college of choice, because it has given me people to hang out with until I am able to meet and feel comfortable with a new group of friends. I have yet to pick out a girl worth going after, even though there are thousands of gorgeous and available women, because I have yet to give up my feelings for an old friend of mine from high school who decided to pursue a tennis scholarship at ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME, LOCNAME, much to my dismay. I frequently talk to her via email and telephone, but we both feel that a long distance relationship would not be the best thing for us at the moment. However, I find it hard to stop thinking about her, because she is exactly what every guy desires in a woman. She is blonde, just shorter than me, has a perfect figure, is very athletic, intelligent, and her father has a lot of money, which is always a plus. The only downfall which she possesses is that she can be clumsy at times. In fact, yesterday she spilled silver nitrate down her shirt in Chemistry Lab, thus causing her to have to us the emergency shower in the back room. To make a long story short, the chemical turned her skin purple and it doesn't wash off for at least two weeks. I am currently living at ORGNAME ORGNAME with three roommates from my high school, one of which is a pain in the ass. He has taken it upon himself to become a fatherly figure or one who scolds us for doing stuff that he doesn't approve of. It has become a nuisance. Anyway, as my nineteenth minute comes to a close I must wrap it up so as not to exceed the guidelines of the assignment. \nAsnwer:"
