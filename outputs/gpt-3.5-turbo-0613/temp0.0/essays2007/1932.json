No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: This is a hard assignment in the sense that I do not know what I am thinking. I have so much homework to do today. I really wish that I had more time to do everything I need to do before a new week starts. I cannot believe that it is already September. I am so ready for another three day weekend. I wish we had another break before Thanksgiving holiday. It is such a pretty day outside. I really should have exercised. I wonder if I will have time tomorrow. Oh well. I really need to go grocery shopping. I have nothing to eat in the apartment. I should ask PROPNAME if she wants to go to the store with me. Something else I need to do is call Grace about my trip to visit her this October. I really hope that the trip works out. I miss her. She is the funniest girl ever. I really want Mexican food for dinner, but I am having Italian. Oh well, Italian could also be good. At least I won't eat a thousand chips before I even get my meal. Instead I will eat about a pound of bread. Does that even make sense? A pound of bread? Oh I guess I mean a loaf of bread. Whatever. It is so quiet in this room right now. I wish there was something going on so that I could have something funny to think and therefore type about. This stream a consciousness essay must be really boring for someone to read. Actually I bet some of them are really interesting to read. I always am wondering what other people are thinking about. I wish that I was a better typer. I am a little faster than I use to be, but I still make a ton of mistakes. This essay could get pretty long considering the amount of thoughts I have in a twenty minute period. Oh I guess that I am not the only person home right now. I heard a door close it must be PROPNAME or PROPNAME. I love living in an apartment. It is so different that last year. I never made my bed. I should get in the habit of making my bed when I get out of bed each day. But then I know I would want to take a nap that day, and then I would just mess up the covers again. Beds are meant to be unmade. I guess that is how I feel now, but wait until I have a family of my own. I totally will be just like my mom and make my kids make their bed every day. I wish that I was as organized as my mom. She always has everything in the right place. I guess I will grow into being more organized one of theses days. I guess? Wow the time really has gone faster than I expected for this essay. but now that I noticed the time I bet it goes even slower. I hate the feeling when you are in class and you think it is at least half over and it really has only been about 00 minutes. That happened to me in math Friday. I think because it was my last class on Friday, I was just anxious for the weekend. I love the weekends. I wish I could have gotten more sleep this weekend. I feel like I never get enough sleep. I in the the mood just to curl up in bed and watch a good movie. I wonder what movie? I really am in the mood for a really good movie that I have not seen or that I love. I have not been to the movie theater in so long. I think the last movie that I saw was Pirates of the LOCNAME. It was good. PROPNAME PROPNAME looked really crazy in the movie. PROPNAME PROPNAME is so cute. I wonder how old he is. I bet he is in his early twenties. Just the perfect age for me. I like the idea of the guy being a little older than the girl just because of maturity. I really wish that I had a crush on someone right now. I feel like there is no one I want to date right now. That is the worse feeling. What time is it. It is getting late. The day has gone by so fast. I need to do so many more things today. I should probably start taking my notes for Geography today so that I don't have so much to do tomorrow. I am so sick of taking notes right now though. I really need to stay motivated!  \nAsnwer:"
