No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well im listening to PROPNAME PROPNAME , what do you think he means by that line lucy loves thisd song she really loved it when i placed i love that part it is so pretty but now i wish hed just end the song wow thisd assignment is goofy i just really want to sleep sleep my head hurts i wondser if this is just me being crazy the medicine shouldn't work that fast should it, am i doing this right, i jusd misspelled right but thats kind of funny because thats what im supposed to do, write. I really wish I wasnt this sad, I left class early today just because i want to be bymyself, i hope they clap that much for me at LOCNAME, what to write next PROPNAME loved this song a lot too, this was our song, whatever she was crazy, that the name of the song, i love the song though , she didn't really love me or she would have shown it. i want a beer right now but all i can drink is water or else ill get really sick, should i be caring about typos I don't think i should be i can't help it, i want to correct them someone knocks PROPNAME wants to chill, but I tell i loved this part am i rightside up or upside down. Am i upside down. PROPNAME PROPNAME, go timmy, wow he's really good at guitar. ian really threw me off i don't know where i was thinking a PROPNAME she did love this song. We had good times with her and we got together on Sept 00 that day brought us together and i said that i worried soooooooo beautiful just another mistake we'll beat bback this pain and ill beat back this pain and ill be me ill be jsut me and it won't matter about friends or college or lax or fraternity i would give you back? what does that mean? Well i just don't know i looked at the clock , i think will weaver is coming back in so many Wills my brother PROPNAME and my roomate too many we should kiull a few. accoustic i want my guitar to sound like that. whats my favorite drink probably vodka with orange juice, crazy, whats crazy PROPNAME is crazy and he can make me smile but now the national anthem plays from somewhere and i can't help but think about the day and the laughter outside in the hall, i htink will is back in the hall with the neighbor PROPNAME and i wonder is this country completely fucked or is just some fucked individuals in chargfe or are we all just stuck in the fucked up circle since the day we were born and i just typed nad instead of and and i smiled again. But now im thinking about thinking and thinking about thinking about thinking, will got mad about me not getting the wristband and i really don't care about the wristband but i wish he wasnt mad, i wish that we would get along better, we need more friends, i think b ecause i love this song so much i sing it lower i hope i feel like this tonight when i see lucy, she can either make me feel incredible like the high life and then others she can make me feel awful just because i want her so bad, but she doesn't mean bad because if she did i would havec nothing to do with her, the typos annoy me so much because i fix some and other i dont. Im feeling better just typing but i felt like death this afternoon. Its kind of scary because the medicine has a warning about suicide attempts i really hope thats not me and it just the placebo that im feeling now,  i actually getting sick of typing now i want to lay down and play guitar and think about what im going to do but that would make me depressed again. I think i will have a beer though, then i will have some water. that will even out i hope, will came in he seems cranky still but i don't give a fuck he's being a dick about the whole thing i offered him a place to stay in LOCNAME and he was completely ungrateful, but whatever, i just looked at the time and thought i was done because i saw the 00 min at the top but really im 00 away im typing what i thought and not what im thinking will in the hall i wish he would just chill out hes so fuckin pissy right now still whatever i wish it was 0 then i would be with lucy i glad she dropped that class now i might get to see her, she doesnt much care for the 000 stuff, i wish that light would stop blinking because i can't reallyk answer right now but it just down there blinking blue then grey is it blinking grey or blinking blue i don't know which its so messed up to think of stuff like that, like when you look at your own name long enough it begins to look like a shape or something Srv so fuckin good the crowd seems to like him too john mayer liked him and played PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is so different but so good but i just want to play baseball right now. im done with this i think now im going to talk to nat now  \nAsnwer:"
