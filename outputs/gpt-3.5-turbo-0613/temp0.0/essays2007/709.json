I began by waking up at 0:00, after only 0 hours of sleep, to go to a 0:00 Art History discussion lab at the museum. It actually crossed my mind to skip class and then go back to sleep, that way I wouldn't be as tired as I am right now. But instead I decided to go ahead and go to class, otherwise I would just fall behind and not know what happend. Personaly, I am not one to really like getting behind, so I think that I made the right decision, granted I may be tired right now, I know my decision to go to class will pay off in the long run. As my day continued, I went to the actual class lecture for  Art history. It was somewhat interesting, although I found it a little difficult to consentrate. I guess that may be because I did not catch up on my reading that I was supposed to have completed by today. Obviously I am paying for the ocnsequenses of not keeping up with the outside responsibilities. Futhur in the day, I went to the dentist to get a filling,  which was not fun!  The right side of my mouth was numb for about 0 hours. That may not sound like too long, but in reality, when your mouth is numb and you can't talk well, and you can't eat or drink anything because you will spill it, it is a long time. Then I proceeded to go to a meeting. I had previously told my room mate that she was able to use my computer while I was gone. This kind of bothered me just because I payed for this computer and I could have just relied on her supplying the computer and used hers. I just don't really think that that is fair. Then what really irritated me, which doesn't happen too ofter, is that when I came back from the meeting, the stuff that was in my chair that she sat in was thrown all on the floor. My brand new shirts that are not even two days old, my purse, and my shorts, were all on the ground. Now it is one hting to use something of someones and put everything back where you found it, but to be so inconsiderate as to not put things back in it's place is rude. I was quite mad, so instead of confronting her, I just left and went to get ORGNAME and to watch tv with my sister. I guess you could say that I did it to get out of confronting her and to also blow some steem off. Oh well, what's done is done, but next time I think that I just might have to say something to her(if I let her use my computer next time). Well, that was pretty much my day, and now I am just trying to get caught up with all of my responsibilities and homework, which is making me stressful. I know that I will be relieved when I finish it all, though. \nAsnwer:"
