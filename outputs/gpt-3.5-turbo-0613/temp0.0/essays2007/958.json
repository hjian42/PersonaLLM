I hope I didn't miss anything in Calculus today, but I can get the notes from PROPNAME. I need to do so much stuff this week with little time to do it in. I need to email PROPNAME and reply to all of the emails I got yesterday. I need to hang up my pictures in my room, but don't have anything to hang them with. I still haven't cashed the check from mom, and I'm running low on money. College is sooooo expensive and there's always too much to do. I hardly have time to do everything that I need to do. I have to pay for all of the clubs I want to join and speaking of that, I have to write essays and fill out applications for TX sweethearts, spirits, the children's hospital, and go to a meeting for AED. I have a meeting at the ADPi house tonight and Wed night!!!!  All these meetings--at least one everyday/night. I also have so much chemistry homework tonight. I keep falling behind in all of my classes. As soon as I catch up in one of them, I fall behind in another. But last night I did a lot of homework, so that helped a little. You know, everytime I am trying to write a thought, twenty more come into my mind. I wonder who looks at these writings and if they get bored of hearing everyone's thoughts. I have to do seven minute abs tonight because my roommate and I are going to for two weeks to see if we can get a six pack. My fingers are starting to tingle from typing so much, so fast. I wonder what's for dinner tonight at the sorority house. I hope it's something healthy. I haven't been eating very healthy since I left home. Not that I ate healthy before but at least I had complete meals, not just pizza or junk food. what else am I thinking of?. maybe if I look around my room. i really need to clean my crap off the floor and desperately need to do laundry. I normally go home to do it but I do not have time to go all the way home and waste time there, waiting for it to dry like last time. although I did promise my brother that I'd bring him up to my dorm to check it out since he hasn't seen it yet. and I really want to see my dogs. I think I miss Bear more than anyone else. probably because I cannot talk to him over the phone or email him like I can my parents. russ calls me nonstop and really gets on my nerves. I feel bad when I'm mean to him but I have so much stuff to do and don't really have time to talk about nothing to him. uh, oh, my sweetmate just got home from yesterday. She stays at her boyfriend's house almost every night. PROPNAME told me that she came in at 0am this morning making tons of noise. she doesn't care about other people and is so self-centered. I hope she doesn't come in here and read this. that'd be very bad. I need to go to TOPS to get my pictures from last friday night. I had so much fun and want something to remember the night by. \nAsnwer:"
