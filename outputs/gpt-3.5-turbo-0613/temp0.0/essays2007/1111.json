After all, college is nothing like high school. I'm a mess; I can't pick the beat. Somehow, I've fallen behind in my life. Pretty much I got to do everything on my own, whereas it used to be people telling me what to do and when to do anything. There was always someone, could be the teacher or mom, constantly laying out the path I should take. Now, it's all up to me now. No one can really help. It's my life. Is this how adulthood feels like? Perhaps, that's just simply a childish question, silly. I can't see what's in front of me, just a big blur, a bit gray. Once again, I want to stay as a kid. Couple of years ago, our English teacher asked us to write a little journal, \"What age would you stay at, if you get to choose?\" Back then, I thought, \"Hey, I am going to go through every phase. That's the experience of life; that's the fun. \" Now, it doesn't feel so fun. Aw, sitting alone in a class of 000 people doesn't seem fun to me. It's funny that I don't have much people to talk to in real life, but there are people online wanting to chat with me, all those high school friends. Somehow they managed to stay 00 hours and 0 days online without much difficulty. I talked to one of them last night, just to keep me awake while I tried to figure my calculus homework. He is quite sociable; I suppose. That reminds me my close friend once called me an antisocialist. Not that I don't want to interact with people. It's just that they weren't the exact right people I want to share my inner self with. And again, I've only found one person I share almost all my thoughts with. I remember in elementary school, I used to walk home with my best friend. We wouldn't feel awkward or funny even if we didn't talk or make some noise on the way home. It felt secured. But ever since we moved to LOCNAME, everything changed. No one here holds the same principle I do; I couldn't outpour what I think inside to those people who think my thinking is so odd, and supposedly weird. I still talked to everyone who wanted to chat with me; I just tell them what I really think inside. I made general comments about whatever they said. This close friend who called me an antisocialist actually talked to me on the phone for almost every night for a couple of years. Even he called me that. I suppose he never reached inside of me; my best friend thinks I talk too much. Funny how both talk to me the equal amount, but they hold the opposite views of me. \nAsnwer:"
