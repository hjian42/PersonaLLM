I'm glad the page has a timer at the top, I really didn't want to keep track of time myself. I have so much work to do today, I'm just glad that I have lots of time to do it. I should probably make sure that I don't misspell words and all of that, it's not like I will have time to check it over when I'm done. I almost feel bad for whoever has to read this, I mean there's probably going to be a large amount of frighteningly boring writings (including mine). Trying to write this with the TV on probably isn't a great idea either, so off it goes. This weekend should be a good time, but I'm still not looking forward to it. I still need to get a birthday present for a friend of mine as well. I should look online to see if she has anything going on the day of the Mars Volta show and get her tickets, that would be very cool. Knowing my luck she probably won't be able to go, but I should still try. Her parent like me enough to let her stay with me, but I don't know when she would go back home. Hopefully she won't have a game that friday, or else none of this will work. I still need to help PROPNAME with her homework, and somehow find time to go to practice tonight. This band really isn't as much fun as I thought it would be. In fact, the music is really boring me. I should talk to them about possibly adding or taking away parts to make it better. These guys listen to way too much indie rock, which means I probably won't have a good chance of making the music any harder. This is going to be a very long writing, so I apologize for whoever has to read this. I hope studying for Latin doesn't take too much time tonight, because I need to get to bed early. It's amazing that I can wake up at 00:00 to be in class by noon, yet I am still tired even if I got like 00 hours of sleep. I don't know how people go to class at 0. I tried an 0:00 class this summer and I ended up not going to it more times than I went. I always figured that going to class would be the easy part; I was wrong. I can still manage to fall asleep in any class so long as its during some sort of lecture. Maybe one of these days I should go to bed at like 0pm and just see when I wake up naturally. Chances are I still won't get out of bed before noon. The night is such a better time to do things. Its not incredibly hot, there's not as many people out, and there are a lot more interesting things to do at night (say on 0th street) than there is during the day. Granted you can't exactly go clothes shopping at 0 in the morning, but you don't get to see bands play during lunchtime either. I can't wait for next weekend. Going down to LOCNAME LOCNAME to see my friends play is going to be a great time. Hopefully I can get some more friends to go with who might like their music. If not, oh well. They are playing with another band that I really enjoy as well, which should make for a very enjoyable time. I should spend more time in LOCNAME LOCNAME, there is a lot of stuff to do there. 0 flags is nice if you have the money, I just don't have the money as of late. I should really try to find a part time job up here so that I can have some resemblance of cash flow. Maybe get a decent job and save up enough money to go somewhere this summer. I would really love to go on a cruise or something like that. Unfortunately, I will probably end up spending the money on bass gear and food. I need food to live though, and bass gear is always good. I still need to do the pretesting after this as well. I don't have a printer either, that could be a pain. Hopefully I can just save the page for printing and simply print it out after I go buy a printer. The time is almost up and it really didn't feel like it took long at all. Maybe that is because I'm used to writing like 0 page papers, I like the simplicity of this. I wonder how many grammar rules I broke during the course of this writing. Oh well. \nAsnwer:"
