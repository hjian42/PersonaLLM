I have to do my first lab write up and I am so confused. I wish I could get it all done now so that this holiday weekend I wouldn't have to worry about it. I am going home this weekend for the first time in a month or so. Even though I am a junior I have felt like such a freshmen this past week becuause I just transfered here. I don't think that's a bad thing , to feel like a freshmen, but it's really weird. I can't wait to go home. I got my parents and my brother a ORGNAME gift form the Co Op I can't believe that PROPNAME is getting married this weekend. I think the wedding will be a lot of fun. I love the dress that I get to wear since I am a bridesmaid. I really though that if anyone was going to get married first it would be me. I am the one that hads the most stable realationship. i really hope taht their marriage works out. They haven't always gotten along really well. In fact when I first met her a year ago he was galavanting around town with some 0 other gulklirls. She is just that type of girl though to go for the \"jerk\" kind of guy. i really think that this was more of a pressure thing that they are doing this because since he went into the ORGNAME ORGNAME and then found out that he was going to LOCNAME I think he was scared to do it alone and he knew that he has always had her buy a string. I n all the time that I have known them they have never been really compasionate to each other and whats worse is that I used to hate him because of how he treated her and all the things I heard about him. well I wish the best for the two of them. I hope I don't forget anything for the wedding this weekend. I am still so nervous about this semester since I am in a new school. I think that I will be okay though because I know how to magage my time and use it wisely. It's dunny because there is always something to do. Tonight I made dinner for my boyfriend, my roomate and 0 of his roomates. That makes me feel good when I can do other things for people like that. We had spagetti salad french bread and I baked some cookies. I am feeling a t peace with myself right now becuase I now that I am doing all I can do to be the best. Not because I made dinner. But because I have gotten so much accomplished today int he way of school work and all the errands I had to run. It is so nice to sit here in this quiet apartment by myself and write for 00 min. I feel bad because I din't work out today. I have been doing really well though by going at least 0-0 times a week and running 0-0 miles a day and then doing weights. For some reason though I feel really fat. When I think about what I ate at dinner I want to gag. Oh my gosh I just thought about my Gov class and how boring it is. It was funny though becuase he was telling us that one student said that it was so boring it made him want to gounge his eyes out with a spoon. That;s hilarious becuase thats kind of how I felt today. The cool thing is that he published his lecture notes and I think they will help out a lot. He is also going to give out the test that he used in the summer for us to study. I don't think I have had a prof with worse organizationl skills. I was trying to take notes and it was so hard becuase he jumps around so much. you got to feel sorry for the guy though. At least he knows that he is not the most interesting guy. He also told us thata student told him that he talked like PROPNAME PROPNAME. Very monotone. That was funny. The more and more I think about it it is true. Geez I can't believe I still have to do that long lab report that is going to take me forever and my TA has still not emailed me beck. At least for the first one she is going to grade them and then return them so we can correct it. That's really cool of her   \nAsnwer:"
