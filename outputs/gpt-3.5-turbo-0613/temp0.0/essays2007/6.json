I am typing it for 0. 0 percent  of my grade. this isn't too bad, it could be worse. twenty minutes isn't that bad. however, I\u2019d rather be playing chess. I don't want to think about school. I just got out of summer school. I took cs000 computer organization and programming and m000k differential equations . that was a rough summer. I almost  reconsidered my degree, but I've come to far now, so I guess I\u2019ll finish. maybe  I\u2019ll do a coop this summer , or take ee000 or both, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad,  I need the money and the credit. who knows. I just want to take a break. at least I\u2019m taking interesting classes. all of them are alright. I just got done with my cs000 homework. I\u2019m glad I switched to PROPNAME's class, and got out of PROPNAME\u2019s class. all of the students that are taking PROPNAME are really hurting now. I talked to one of his students, she hates that class. I think PROPNAME's class is alright. oh well. this isn't that bad at all. I need to get a job though . my loan is going to run out on me pretty soon. it's nice to not have to work though. I like waking up late on the weekends and not have to get ready for work at 0 o'clock. that sucked. no more restaurants for me. no sirree. I hate working in  the food industry now. that really really sucked. I like the people there. I\u2019m going to miss them. I had a lot of fun, going out, partying, meeting new people. I can't stand the restaurant business anymore anyway. just as soon as you meet people the quit or get fired , move or whatever. and the management sucks. I want to get a more laid back job where all I have to do is be there because the business needs someone there, just to be there. I think ill be a proctor next semester for cs000, I don't know what I\u2019ll do this semester, maybe I\u2019ll ask my mom for money. she said she would give me money now that I\u2019m at ORGNAME. oh well . I just want to play chess. I almost got my rank up to 0000, I think I can do it if I pick on the 000 and 0000 crowd. that would be nice. I've almost got  another name up to 0000 and 00+ games. that win I had at the tournament  was sweet . my time for writing this assignment is almost up . hah hah. this is  easy points. I just hope I do well on the tests . I better start reviewing this stuff. I've got the chapter read and 0 hours of experiments done. I just need to  review a little bit tonight . I need to do the vocabulary. I need to do my vocabulary for cs000 too. and review matrix multiplication for m000l. I have to wake up at 0 am . that sucks. but my classes will be over pretty soon. that will be nice. I get out at about 0 o'clock on those days, which is nice, I can take a nap and then study or something, waste time, and then study, or whatever. I just have free time. for now. later it should get harder. I hate thinking about school. I want to play chess or go read a book or go out or something fun. its 0 o'clock . just a few more minutes of this and I\u2019ll be done. jeez this seems like a long time to right  now that I think about it . my hands are getting tired . I wish I couldn't type very well right now. oh well . I\u2019m going to get carpal tunnel from this. maybe not. I don't know. who cares. I think I\u2019ll just finish this thing of with a bunch of . what do you call them. phrases that people. oh yeah. wait a minute, I forgot again. what is it. hmmmmm. oh yeah. cliches, that's it . I can just finish this thing off with a bunch of cliches. waste time. but I forgot any cliches . so I guess I can't finish this off with cliches. but I wish I knew a bunch of cliches to finish this last few minutes off with . that s ok though it's not so bad . I can just let my mind wander like it always does. the count , PROPNAME PROPNAME's dead. bela lugosi's dead. PROPNAME PROPNAME's dead. undead. undead. undead. undead. undead. undead. I\u2019m listening to Bauhaus right now. one of my favorite bands. maybe . I like them at least. I want to get the Fields of Nephilim album. I think they only have one album out. they were pretty good though. almost as good as Bauhaus, or maybe Bauhaus was almost as good as them. it's hard to tell. I like them both a lot. I just need to get the money to buy the album. I hate not being able to get more music. I m addicted to music. I am suffering from CD withdrawal. ah ! it sucks! oh well just one more minute . one more minute of typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typing typging typing typing  typing and I\u2019m done. bye. \nAsnwer:"
