No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: For the past couple of weeks, I have been wondering about one question: Why am I here? As I go from class to class I look around at all the other students just like me standing around like they are waiting for something. What are they waiting for? Should I be waiting for something? A lot of changes have happened to me in the past 0 weeks. As these changes take place, I wonder, \"I guess this is what everyone is supposed to do. Everyone gets caught up in doing what is expected from everyone else. If I were to ask someone as I walk by, \"Why are you here at LOCNAME?\" an overwhelming majority would probably reply by saying, \"I don't know\" or \"That's a good question. \" So with that said, I ask myself, \"Why am I here?\" I guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. If that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? PROPNAME PROPNAME is a prime example. He is not your everyday college dropout. He is making more money than probably 00 percent of college graduates. So is college a way of evening everyone out? Someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the American Dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the American Dream, but got it spoiled by being \"brainwashed\" in college. So what exactly does \"brainwashed\" mean? Everywhere I have been in college, there are professors talking about, \"When you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. \" NONSENSE. I don't want to work for someone. Nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok  paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn. I don't want to have to \"use\" my degree when I \"get a job. \" I want to hire other people to use their degree. On second thought, I'm glad professors tell college students to find a job with a big company when they graduate. That big company is going to be me. \nAsnwer:"
