No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Man I wish I could go home, I really miss PROPNAME I know he is right down stairs but I wish he would come over. I can't wait until my sister comes today, we will have so much fun, oh I need to do my homework for math, and I can't forget to go to that meeting at 0:00. That reminds me of what I have to find out about it the subject I want to do. I wish PROPNAME would wake up I can't believe she was out until 0:00 last night, that is really late, but I guess since she didn't have any classes it is not that big of a deal. I want to eat lunch, I'm really hungry, I need to pack to, I can't believe I have to pack to go down the street, that is so stupid, I need to call my mom and tell her to get nicci to bring that shoulder bag. For next weekend. I'm tired. I wish I were asleep like PROPNAME. I wonder what our homework for linguistics is? I guess I need to look. This is a really weird thing to do, I wonder if I am doing it right, and what they will find out about me. I wonder if I am crazy, I don't think so though. I miss my mommy! I wish I was going home instead of staying here, but I guess that is ok. PROPNAME is so stupid sometimes. I need to not forget my stuff in the dryer. I wish blaire and PROPNAME didn't fight all the time, I mean I love them both, but they are so annoying when they argue. Oh yeah, I need to figure out where ORGNAME's is so we don't get lost, I guess I can look on the Internet. I love Family Feud, and playing it online, but it is hard, cause I always am talking to people and when I am trying to play that stinks. I'm glad PROPNAME and PROPNAME are my friends, and I'm glad I'm in the fig, it was such a good idea. But I wish I didn't have to take English over again. I wish I could just be in the fig and have just Math and Psychology. I am so tired, I can't believe I had to get up for one class today, I should have just slept in, it is all cloudy and everything any way, why should I get up when it is so dreary outside. Math is so easy; I don't have to go there to understand it. I could just get the homework assignment and I wouldn't need to listen to her talk. Man this is really hard to think of things to write I feel like my mind isn't thinking. I wonder how much longer my stuff in the dryer has. I don't like having to write everything I think, oh yeah I need to call and see how many minutes my phone has on it, so I don't go over. That is a lot of money if I go over my time. I need to look up the phone number to find out how many I have. I wonder whom I call, the place I bought the phone or ORGNAME, I don't know. I am thinking about thinking, I can't think any more. This is so weird. I wonder what lee is doing. I wonder if I am disturbing PROPNAME's sleep, oh well she disturbs mine when I am trying to sleep all the time. Man, I really am hungry now; I wish my 00 minutes would hurry up and get over with. I guess I am thinking about doing something else besides this. I am tired of typing. 00 minutes feels like along time when you type continuously. I wish I could think about something else. I can think about sleep, it is good. My bed is too hard though. I need to talk to my mom about that mattress store. I wonder if what PROPNAME said was true? I mean that is crazy if that really happened. I need to go to the store. I need to order nicci's bday cake. Man I'm cold. That fan is really powerful. I wish lee would hurry up and pack so that we could go eat, I'm hungry, but I don't know what to eat, the cafeteria always stinks and the place down stairs is so stinking expensive. I wish that the deli thing would open it will be so good. I wonder what kind of bread they will have. My contacts are drying out from this fan, but luckily I don't have much time left to write. Thank goodness. I hate typing all my thoughts for so long the time seems forever away. I wonder if I am using to many dining dollars, I need to go look and see. I need to pay my thing too. My face itches. Ok it's better. I guess my time is almost up! YEAH! I'm hungry I think I'm almost finished. I need to hurry up and eat though, because I have to get my clothes out of the dryer, so no one steals them. Ok, I'm finished. I need to spell check it now. Bye \nAsnwer:"
