No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: well as I was clicking on the button that allows you to begin, I noticed that I forgot the last digit of my social security number, aka, ut eid. well for whoever care, it is 0. my I'd number is 000000000. there now I can get credit for this assignment. anyway, I don't know what to write about. I'm sure that after a while your stream of consciousness\" I totally spelled that wrong, will take over. I bet everyone writes this at the beginning of their assignment just because they don't know what else to write about and aren't bored enough to be honest yet. so I am really mad about my laptop. last night is just turned white and shut down. I tried turning it on this morning and it wouldn't so I took it to the its  or something like that. it is the place where they are supposed to fix your computer. well they didn't. nope they just gave ma 0 0oo number to call which took me 00 minutes and I still didn't talk to a real person. I always type didn't instead of didn't. that is annoying. so I took the battery out of my computer and it works now but I still need a new battery which better be under warranty because I just got the thing in may. so I go to check my e mail and what do you know, I have another freaking virus on my computer. I am about to scream. seriously, I am using my roommates computer right now. it is the second one since I got here in june and it is pissing me off. I mean  I am not even one of those internet surfing kids, I just use it for research and e mail and papers and stuff so I don't even know how I got the dang thing. so now I have decided to type with the correct hand position so my typing is considerably slower and my spelling considerably poorer. ya screw this. I wish I would have paid attention in keyboarding class. man, I am only half way done. so this is my roommate's computer. she is sleeping right now. don't get me wrong, I love the girl to death but she is freaking emotional. it was her and her boyfriends 0 year anniversary today. I don't think he is good for her. my arm is starting to hurt. I know why it is because here in jester you have no freaking desk space and the fridge is shoved into your back. in kinsolving it was heaven. I miss it there a lot better community. my professor was talking about freshman insecurity or whatever today. he was right. I don't consider myself to be an insecure person but college will do it to ya, especially when you don't know anyone. I bet there are people like me who can just sit here and type crap, never letting on to what they are really thinking about. I obviously already have a little, but to tell you the truth, I am really thinking about how bad I am at typing. I don't know why I think I have to type fast for this. it isn't like you are counting my words. actually, it is just making it harder for me to continue my bullshit, excuse the French. why do people say that?  I think my dog back home is depressed. I know she misses me, I'm the only one she liked. she is always at my neighbor's house because they let her in and feed her. the sad thing is, I think my neighbor is trying to replace her husband with my odg. they just got divorced, one of the super religious couples you would never expect to. she is such a softie anyway. ya I def think that she is using my dog for company. I don't know why though because she already has two dogs of her own. ok well I have this meeting to go to tonight. it is for the lassos, no wait, the lonestars. I can't forget to call my friend lindsay or is it lindsey so we can meet to walk there. ya I am about to nope, I just did sneeze. God bless me. I think everyone should believe in God. he is great  even if there is no proof, that is where faith comes in right?  right. \nAsnwer:"
