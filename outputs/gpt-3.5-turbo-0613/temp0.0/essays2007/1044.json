Thought everything is just going to be fine when suddenly a lady who pulled her car behind me bumped into the back bumper of my car. I pulled to the side and got out of the car. She got out too and I looked at my bumper just a few scratches. I let her go. I am in a hurry! I have a doctors appointment at 0pm and there is no time to waste not to mention this writing assignment is due at 0pm. there goes my afternoon! This is been a busy week and a depressing one. I knew I was going to see PROPNAME at the ORGNAME meeting but somehow I knew even though I didn't want to see her. I still ended up saying hi to her. What is wrong with me!?!?! I should have just skipped it. I should have also not forced PROPNAME to go into the CSA meeting room. I think she got a little mad at me. I didn't really care. She said she saw PROPNAME and she doesn't want to go in there and let him see her. She is afraid that he would say something to PROPNAME or PROPNAME or those dumb losers. Even though they were my high school friends, I still think PROPNAME has changed. Well people change. What can I say? I changed for the worst. Does anyone change for the best???? Sometimes I wish I would have made some choices that are good and the outcome would be better. But I end up making the bad ones that I am regretting. Oh well. my friend PROPNAME is messaging me again on I'M maybe it's time to go. Mom is coughing I hope she is ok. She said she is sick because of the car accident. I wonder how bad it was. It was my fault. I shouldn't have left so early that afternoon so they had to take my brother back to LOCNAME. You see another bad choice of mine. What can I say!?!?!. I am speechless really want to change radically. Stop smoking stop procrastinating daydreaming live for the present??? \nAsnwer:"
