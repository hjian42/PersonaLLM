My fist class was at 0:00 in the morning and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought I wouldn't be able to understand the professor at all, but surprisingly I understood him very well and I understood what he was talking about. It was a review over stuff we were suppose to have learned already, and it was all so familiar to me. I guess I really did learn something last year in Calculus. I did have a really good teacher and I did well on the Calc AP exam. I have to remember to write a thank you note to my high school professor. He was the coolest. He was so passionate about what he was teaching and he really got me into what he was discussing. I understood it very well and actually enjoyed it too. I wish I had teachers like him in other subjects I took in HS. M economics teacher was not to good. It was an AP course too and I really felt that I didn't learn much. Now I'm going to take an economics class in college. I hope I get the same relaxed feeling as in my business Calculus class. The professor seems pretty cool. And maybe others in the class had not so good teachers too, so they are at the same disadvantage as me. Either way I'm going to study hard and stay on top of things in my class, so I can eventually do well. If there's one thing I learned in High ORGNAME, it's to stick with it. Starting out in high school, all I wanted was the easy way out, because the experience was so overwhelming to me and it was too scary. But at the end I started to see the big picture that in the end it is all worth it. In the end I will get a good grade trough all the hard work I put forth and then I can have that satisfied feeling that I did good and all my work paid off, so I must continue it. So I got in the habit of working my hardest and hoping to see the good result that are so satisfying to see. I usually get to see those results I so desperately work for but if not I work even harder the next time so I can finally see the results I was looking for. My High School was extremely competitive and I managed to keep up and just make it in the top ten percent. I'm very proud of myself, and where I am today. Many hispanic females such as myself with the same background are not as fortunate as me. In fact, most of my girl friends are working or going to a community college where I just don't see as much as opportunity as that which will be revealed to me at the ORGNAME ORGNAME School. Already I've been hearing in some of my classes that students tried out for the business school but didn't get in. That makes me feel so proud and honored for the position I am in. Other students have told me how hard they are trying to get into the business school. Again, I realize how lucky I am. I can't see myself majoring in anything else besides Business, maybe psychology, but that would be it. Psychology was my second choice for a major. I was that close to being a psychology major. So, now I know it was meant to be. I've had an accounting internship already, and I 'v e been to numerous business programs, which I have enjoyed very much. It brings me so much joy to say that I just may have found my niche because I know that this major includes all things that I enjoy. \nAsnwer:"
