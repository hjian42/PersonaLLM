Anyway,  my Girlfriend is not talking to me today. It actually started yesterday because she says that I don't back her up. Whatever. Anyway, Lately we have been getting into a lot of fights. I think she is only PMSing this time thought. Oh well. PROPNAME left his ORGNAME on my desk. He better leave today,  That boys got to go home. I'm actually typing kind of fast now. PROPNAME's Pekkle is so dirty. I need to make more friends. I also need to call either PROPNAME or PROPNAME and find out when the IEEE meeting is tonight. I still have to write for 00 more minutes. It took me a long time to Get on to the psy homepage. I wonder why because all the other Internet sites I go to always show up real fast. I guess PROPNAME is not going to go with me to sign up for psychology experiments. By the way I thing that these experiments that we have to do are BS. I think that that the psychology department needs someone to experiment on so they make the psy000 students be the guinea pigs( I think I spelled that wrong. Oh well. )  If we don't do the experiments they punish the students by making them write a 0 to 00 page paper. Ultimatum. I really need to work on my spelling but I won't. Oh yea I also have to pay the $0 it owe ORGNAME. I'll do that by PROPNAME after I finish this essay. I still have 0 minute left. I really hate writing papers. I'm Glad that I got out of English. Everybody says that I need to get into study groups if I want to survive Engineering. I Need to get into some study groups I guess. By the way I didn't mean to caps the \"need\" in the last sentence. Oh well. It's 0:00 So I guess I'm about done now. LOCNAME \nAsnwer:"
