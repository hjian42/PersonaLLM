No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: It is the first time that I have done this and I don't think it is at easy as it sounds. For though there are no mathematical equations to solve I do think it is pretty hard to keep on writing without stopping for such a great amount of time (00 minutes is a lot of time) I don't really know what to keep on writing, since right now I am just worried about the fact that this are going to be the longest 00 minutes of my life. I have just received and email of my cousin and I'm so glad because she is now working and it makes me think how great it would be for me to get a job, since today I went again, to speak to the person in charge in the cactus caf\u00e9 and no one was there, and the girl told be that there were no open jobs and specially not at the time that I need. I really want to work because I don't want to spend more money given to me by my parents since I'm fully aware that they need it for things far more important that what I am using the money for (clothes, food, personal expenses in general. When the eternal 00 minutes go by I shall reply to my cousins email and express to her the great gratitude I feel towards her email since at the present time she has been one of the only people in my family, which have supported us in this time of nee. This is really hard for me because I feel like I'm writing like a two year old since this isn't my native language. It would be so much more comfortable if I could write in my language, since when my mind is working it is usually processing information in English. Right now the phone is ringing and I guess this is PROPNAME since he said he was going to call. I really hope its not anyone from home for I would be really disappointed and sad if they called and me being here did not pick up the phone just because I am doing this stupid homework which at the time seems pretty irrelevant, to what I am feeling at the present time. I am just repeating myself and a set of common American expressions that come to my mind, this is pretty stressing because I want to look at the monitor and check out how much have I written and specially I want to check out the timer. for I have taken a cooking timer to control my minutes typing so that I wouldn't have to stop to watch the clock. While typing other thoughts go past my mind but they are probably in Spanish and I am probably just ignoring them so that I don't make typos, this makes me think of my stupid physics teacher, I'm so glad I don't have to take any more physics in my whole life. I don't really know what I want to study, each time I go to the introduction to psychology class my mind plays tricks on me and I start visualizing myself in various occupations and I'm not quite sure of which one truly fits me. I couldn't resist so I took a look at the timer and I just realized that only ten minutes have passed and they have passed so slowly, its like when you are up at night not being able to sleep and scared of the dark and listening to the clicking of the clock and time just passes so slowly. Well I would just like to get it over with since I am basically trashing 00 minutes in front of this computer not doing any real thinking or insight process but just mechanically typing and typing and typing and when I make a mistake I just press the backspace and keep on going. Well since I don't know what else to say I'll keep on exploring my thoughts related to my future and my career. I think a really important issue is due to me, going to this jerk astronomer who separated my life into two: before and after I went. I am really worried of what he said dealing with marriage and divorce, it has always been a fear I have had and that day he just said it to me as if nothing was the matter. And of course something is the matter because once they tell you something like that you won't be able to forget it ever. Also what he said about me having problems with my baby like miscarriages or stuff well I think he shouldn't have said that either. I wish I could have entered the business school since I would be having a respectable title of a carrier but since I didn't then I just en up having all these classes, which I really enjoy but which are making me feel more confused. I really like the university and the classes and the teachers, but I haven't made many friends and although I know it has nothing to do with my self worth I do feel a little upset because I have been hirer for over three weeks and still I don't feel like I have a lot of friends. I just took a look at the watch and I think this is finally it! \nAsnwer:"
