    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I really don't know what to say. I am just doing some assignment for the Psychology class. It is an interesting class, yes, and I am happy to be in it. I am now looking at my pencil. This pencil has been with me for about a year and I still have not lost it. I usually loose these pens and pencils within 0 or 0 weeks. My roommate just picked up the phone and started talking to a friend of mine. It seems that LOCNAME just won the football game. I am happy to hear that. Again I am thinking what am I going to write for this assignment. Yes, I can type pretty fast but to write for 00 minutes, I really don't know what I will be saying?! I am a junior by hours at ORGNAME but I am actually a sophomore in electrical engineering. I work as a grader for EE000 class and I really like doing the job. Only thing is, I hate failing students but what can I do? If I don't, they will fail the other chapters to come. My roommate is laughing right now and distracting my thoughts from this assignment! Oh, well! I hope my friend who is studying in the library does not call me right now while I am doing this work. My friend and I are supposed to go and eat at PROPNAME soon. I really hope he does not interrupt me. I am feeling hungry now and I am getting tired for typing for a long time even though only about 00 minutes have passed. I wish the food was better for me to eat at the cafeteria. Unfortunately, the food is not great. My friend just called me but I am continuing writing. I told him to call me back in 00 minutes. Hopefully, I will be finished with this assignment. I can hear the conversation between my roommate and one of my friends over the phone. They are talking about going to 0th street. I probably would like to go but I think I need to call my brother and sister today. Anyway, that is life and I need to do all this work. I am really tired and now, my thoughts just don't flow anymore. I hear the bathroom toilet flush in the community bathroom. The room is suddenly cold and I wish I wasn't wearing shorts. Oh well. now what. I wish work was just bla bla bla and a whole lot of rubbish. However, it is not that easy. I want to get this assignment done with. Why wasn't it 00 minutes instead of 00 minutes? I wonder what the results of this experiment are going to be? What are they going to help with? I am really hungry and the only thing that is stopping me is this work. Please finish, please finish. a door just slammed because someone closed it hard. I wonder why. anyway, I am tired now. I don't want to write a research report for Psychology but I also don't want the experimentation in psychology to take a lot of time for me. I think I will stick with the experiments. I love being a grader in EE000. People look up to me but I have to remember to be humble to them because they are also human beings who are just as intelligent as me and they are all good people. I wish I could see my parents, my brother and sister right now. Unfortunately, I can't since I am an international student. I wonder how my friends from high school are doing. I hope they are doing well. Oh well, I have to go. Is it time, yet? Let me check. phone rings. PROPNAME called my roommate. a cool guy. I have to do something right now. it seems both my roommate and PROPNAME went to the same party yesterday and had good fun. Come on finish up. yes it is done. Thank you. my hands are really tired. Bye and thank you \nAsnwer:"
