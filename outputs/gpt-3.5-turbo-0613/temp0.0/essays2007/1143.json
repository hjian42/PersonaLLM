No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Ok well this seems like an informal assignment, so I'm going to treat it that way. And presently I have a bone to pick with women. I'm going to let you know about a little situation I have undergone recently, and see if I can figure out why women are so weird. Ok so first off, I had this girl, we'll call her PROPNAME, that I have been in love with since 0th grade but never got a chance to pursue. As a background on her, she is a player; meaning that she likes to lead guys on, then break their hearts. But she still had me swooning over her for some reason. She has been my best friend for almost 0 years and so I this summer I decided to give it a shot and ask her out, after all I had nothing to lose. So I asked her out, and she said no because: \"the timing is wrong, college is coming up and I don't want to start anything because I like you so much that I think it would actually be a relationship and not just a game for me\". So this gets me mad and so I just decided to play along with her and hope she would eventually give in to let me have just 0 date with her. Throughout the summer I continued to pursue her with minimal success. She then left off to school and I never got my chance. Then 0 weeks ago she came and stayed with me and we ended up making out all night long for no apparent reason at all. It was very out of the ordinary, but I wasn't going to complain because I liked her so much. So she started acting really weird after that day, and just ignored me. When I confronted her last night, she told me \" I just don't know what to think, I just thought of you as my best friend, and then that all happened and I don't know why and I enjoyed it but I feel strange now. \" So of course she is just saying this because she wants to maintain control over my feelings and keep me here in case she can't get a date in school up where she goes. I don't like this idea though, so I conjured up a plan that would stop this. She just loves to play mind games so I started playing mind games back, by leading her on and then just not talking and some various other tactics. Eventually I won and she stopped being weird, but last night when I confessed that I was doing the mind game thing to get back at her, she went haywire and got all mad because \"I took control of her feelings with no care whatsoever\". So my dilemma and all I can think about now is why women are so weird. Not only is she a strange girl, but my ex girlfriend is also adding to my confusion. She is also attending ORGNAME and we broke up before we came here, and now she is mad because I am moving on with my life and not just out chasing her around like I used to. This makes her mad so she spends all her time trying to make me mad in various ways that don't work and it is just weird, I do not understand it at all. My friend's dad told me he would write me a check for 0 million dollars if I could figure out women, and with my recent situation, it seems like it is never going to happen. Aside from all this chaos going through my mind while I'm conscious, I have dreams about these two girls in my sleep, and they don't make sense either. So alas I am just sitting here confused pondering why women are so difficult and why they think they have such control over guys' feelings. I don't think I will ever understand but I can't stop thinking about it. And since we were only supposed to type for 00 minutes, and being the slow typist I am finished now, so that's all that is on my mind. I must say though, this assignment could be good because I feel better just venting like this. \nAsnwer:"
