I was playing free cell on my computer before. Yeah, I was that bored. Wow, this is what college is like. My roommate is sleeping right now. That's all she ever really does. Sleep and eat. speaking of eating I'm kinda hungry even though I had boba tea and a spring roll like at about 00. I really need to stop these late night temptations! yeah I really don't want to gain the freshman 00 as they call it. I want to go home this weekend but I really shouldn't. I have a lot of crap to study for. I want to go home to see my grandma and my dog. I'm not using very good grammar or punctuation in this assignment. I hope whoever reads it does not think I'm a complete moron I'm just lazy! yeah my laziness often gets in the way of things oh well. that is life. now I'm not thinking about anything much. I wonder if we are going to have one of those random pop quizzes in bio tomorrow. I hope not. I didn't do much today partially because I went to eckards to buy myself some cold medicine and orange juice!  I believe in my vitamins. hhahaha ok no!  that was retarded. I think I'm getting sick. ARRGH  I hate getting sick because it always lasts for a while and now I can't miss classes. damn college. I don't know how people who miss class do it. I would always be scared that there would be some sort of pop quiz or the professor going over some random things that will be on a test. like I say GRR to college. I kinda miss high school now that I'm not there. I hate the way time just moves on and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. I was thinking about that today and there isn't much time till I'm 00! only like 0 years. I never imagined myself even being 00. I guess I don't realize how much I have really changed. Not many people realize whenever they change kinda like you don't really realize whenever u change physically. Grr sorry. I accidentally pressed the finish key but I was not finished since there were like 0 minutes still left so I'm going to continue blabbing for 0 minutes. its only fair. I really do wonder what the hell my life is going to be like in 00 years. It seems that then everything is going to change. Coming out of high school whenever I think about it not much has changed. well the people that I see have changed and my surrounding has changed a bit but I still talk to my best friends. My room mate has been my friend since middle school. I hope that living together won't interfere with our friendship since everyone has those horror stories where they shared a dorm room with their best friend and then they become enemies. I don't think that will happen to us. at least I really hope not. I really do hope that I will soon get over him. this is kinda random but I think about him a lot. I don't even know what is so great about him. nothing really. I guess I still like the person he used to be. USED TO BE is the key word. oh well. I will get over him. Anyways. my continued 0 minutes are about to be up. I hope my blabering was not too stupid and mindless. Oh well! bye bye    \nAsnwer:"
