No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Wow, this is incredibly hard to follow my thoughts when I am focused on this. It is too hot outside, I really don't want to walk all the way over to PROPNAME today. My head hurts. College is so stressful, and I feel like I have a heavy weight on my chest. My roommate is annoying. She does not go to sleep until after 0 in the morning, and I can't sleep with the lights on. I am absolutely exhausted. I don't like NYPD Blue. Why aren't there any good shows on when I am actually in my room and able to watch TV?  My head is starting to hurt more. I am straining my eyes too much. My chair is in a really awkward position with my keyboard. I don't know how I am going to write for 00 minutes. It has only been 0 minutes and it seems like an eternity. Cherry coke is yummy. Stupid computer!  It keeps freezing up on me. I hate technology. Our room looks so unbalanced. My side is really decorated and my VI equipment takes up a lot of room, but my roommate's side is very bare. She isn't a very decorative person anyway. One of my friends is coming to visit on Saturday while her husband is at the UT vs. LOCNAME game. I am nervous about seeing her. She is worried about me and wants to spend time talking. I don't know what I am going to tell her, because I don't want her to be disappointed in me. I am such a horrible person. I don't know why I am the way I am. It really hurts. She wants me to go and see a secular psychologist if I get desperate enough, but I don't like psychologists. Especially if I don't know them. There is nothing wrong with me though. It is all a matter of learning to bury bad things inside of you. I miss my friend PROPNAME. I talked to her last night. Skittles are cute and yummy. They are so colorful. They cheer me up. My heel hurts from resting my feet on my hard drive. I am thirsty. I think I will take a sip of my cherry coke now. Wow, it has only been 00 minutes. My tummy hurts. When I get nervous my tummy gets upset. I really need to wash out my cereal bowl from last night. But I am too tired right now. Maybe later. The weather can't decide what it wants to do. It goes back and forth from being sunny and cloudy. I like it cloudy because the sun hurts my eyes and it is so very hot. Plus I am allergic to the sun, and I break out every time I am in it for any length of time. So not a good thing. I cut my finger on my soup can the other night. I have so much homework to do and I don't know how I am going to get it all done. The Psychology book is so boring. I can't get into it to read for any length of time. I miss my drill team. I won't get to see them until Christmas break. It was such a huge part of my life for the last 0 years that I am lost without it now. My friend PROPNAME has a bad cold. I took her a care package two days ago. I wonder how she is feeling. OUCH! I rolled my foot wrong. That hurt. When are my twenty minutes going to be up?  I am getting tired of writing. This is a very odd assignment. I hope I am doing it right. Oh well if I am not. My head itches. Hmmm. That's interesting. My lips are really chapped. They kinda hurt. I wonder where I put my carmez. Just another minute and a half. Hmmm. I hope it does not rain today since my class is all the way across campus. That would not be enjoyable. Especially since I carry my laptop with me. Well my time is almost up. Ten seconds. Yay I am almost through. \nAsnwer:"
