No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am watching an episode of Mad TV and they were doing a parody on the whole parish priest / alterboy thing, singing PROPNAME's \"Hot in LOCNAME\". The whole thing makes me sick when I think about it. My desktop died on me while I was up at LOCNAME and I am shopping for a new computer. The soonest I could get one would probably be Christmas, because of the long delay in shipping and the safety issues of shipping it to home and having no one there to sign for it and shipping it to the dorm where someone might take it and I would never see it. But it really sucks that my desktop would just crap out like it did. At least I still have my laptop, even thought it is a brick, weighing over 00 pounds, but I chose it and paid for it. All in all, life on the computer side just sucks. I wrote this during Labor Day long weekend, so I just sitting here at home in LOCNAME until tomorrow when I go back to LOCNAME for a long haul, as I call it where I don't go back home until another holiday/long weekend. But I don't mind, I really enjoy living in LOCNAME, although the dorm I live in sucks due to construction noises. I have late classes on ORGNAME and I don't get up until like 00, but I still am awakened by construction at 00 or so. Even though I didn't know my roommate until I move in with him, I do not regret going potluck. He is pretty cool, and he respects my wishes and I do the same for him. He has early classes on the same days that I do, so he doesn't bother me when he gets up in the morning, and I don't bother him when I wake up, because he has the same classes at the same times as I do. So that is cool. It's an oddity that I am writing this, for I do not really know how to write papers. So I decided to write this like I would for my blog on ORGNAME, like I am writing to my best friends. When I get back to LOCNAME, I need to get my Calculus book and maybe find a movie that me and my friends can go to, just as kind of a day off thing to kill time before the daily grind starts again. Sadly II feel like this after only one and a half weeks of school at ORGNAME, into my freshman year. But the work is not the problem, the problem is the walking, but I will have to just get used to that aspect of UT. \nAsnwer:"
