    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have never had an asignment like this before. It is hot in my dorm room. I always feel sweaty especially at night. It is difficult to sleep. Now that we are a few weeks in to school I can feel my self getting more and more stressed out every day. The workload is quit large, and I never have enough time to do everything i need to do. Actually right now I am between classes but i only have and hour to do this assignment, do some calculus, and eat lunch. I know I won't do one of those three. I probably won't eat lunch. Even though I am starving. i went to today and got a wristband for the OU game. The draw for tickets is tommorrow morning so i guess i am going to miss class to stand in line. If i do that and don't get a ticket i will not be happy. I wander where my girlfiend is right now i havnt seen her at all today. We live in the same building and I still rarely see her. Usually only at night, and even then we study so we don't talk much. I miss all the time we spent together when we still lived at home. We both went greek so between her sorority my fraternity and school there is maybe 00 min a day left for just talking to each other. Hopefully things will get easier later on in the semester. I live at PROPNAME so i have three roommates, and one of them is trying to teach himself the guitar. I am really sick of hearing his stupid guitar. Plus he sucks at it. i just accidentally pushed the back button on my computer, and when i pushed forward what i had already typed was still here but the timer started over. I wonder if that matters. I don't have time to keep tying for another twenty minutes. I am serously considering not going to my next class. I just want to eat lunch and take a nap. I just realized something funny my next class is pyschology. Oh well just because i am doing the assignment doesn't mean i have the energy to go to class. Who am i kidding i am to worried about missing something important so i will go even though i am really tired. During the last lecture i fell asleep for about 00 minutes and woke up really confused. I have so much work i have to get done before friday. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem but my fraternity has something going on every night this week, and since i am a pledge i am expected to be there. My time is just about up so i am going to stop typing now. \nAsnwer:"
