No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Ok, I am really happy right now because after 0 weeks of BS, I've finally got my computer and Ethernet working so that I could do my psychology  homework. Cool, huh. Well, my best friend from LOCNAME LOCNAME just called me  and told me she's gonna get a tattoo, which I think is pretty dumb  because she's gonna be stuck with it for the rest of her life. See,  I would get a tattoo, like my zodiac sign or something, but I just  always see myself all grown up and old and wrinkly with a tattoo and I think I would feel pretty dumb for getting it then. Like,  right now I just have my ears pierced once in each ear and I\u2019d  like to get 0 more in my left ear and 0 more in my right ear but  its still kinda like I\u2019m gonna be to old for that kinda stuff in a  few years, you know?  What else can I bore you with?  Oh, my mom sent  me a package and I got it today, it was my dry cleaning and some pictures of my dog, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, he's a basset hound. PROPNAME is  a family name, its my granddad\u2019s and my older brother's middle name. Hmmmmmm. . I'm like so happy that tomorrow is Friday, not like I\u2019m stressed out or anything, its just a huge adjustment to go from partying all the time in the summer to only partying Friday and Saturday night, I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't  go out on school nights. I really don't have much self control or discipline, but I\u2019m working on it. I was so happy last  night, I was in my next door neighbors room and everybody was  checking their email and I was just like no, no one has emailed me, but I tried anyway and low and behold, one of my best friends from LOCNAME LOCNAME had emailed me, I was so surprised. See, he was  suppose to move to LOCNAME, NM but it fell through when he  got there so he came back, but he's moving to LOCNAME in a day or two but he told me he was going to be back in El Paso for thanksgiving except he didn't have a place to stay, and I really hope my mom doesn't  mind, but I offered to let him stay in our extra bedroom. Oh, then I  did one of the stupidest things I\u2019ve done in a while, I told him  that I\u2019ve had the biggest crush on him since the day I met him,  GOD I'M DUMB!!! oh well, its over and done with now, can't change the  past, huh. It'd be cool if you could change the past though cause god knows I\u2019ve done a whole lot of dumb things in my life. ok, sorry, my  twenty minutes were up 0 minutes ago so have a nice day. Bye   \nAsnwer:"
