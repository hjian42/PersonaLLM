No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I just got back from math class, and surprisingly, I feel good despite my lack of sleep for the past 0 weeks. Or I should probably say my irregular sleep patterns. But anyway, I'm not looking forward to my economics class, but my psychology class is a different story. I like my professor, he actually keeps the class interesting, as well as entertaining/comical, unlike my economics class. I dread that class every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I would not be surprised if I fell asleep in that class today. But there is one advantage to going to economics LOCNAME, or should I say PROPNAME. I got to stop calling her LOCNAME. I wonder if she gets offended. I hope she knows that I mean well, and besides, she's so cool. Not to mention, fine as all hell. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight, I hope I see PROPNAME. Woooooohh deeee! She is the most gorgeous, absolute prettiest, hottest girl I have ever seen in my entire life, hands down, bar none. And yes, I am keeping PROPNAME in mind. PROPNAME would be a close second. I wonder how PROPNAME is doing, I miss her. I should probably respond to her email, considering she did email me 0 WEEKS AGO! That's alright, I can just come up with another excuse, like always. That could be the problem with me. I just put things off and blame it on laziness. But I don't want to go into that right now, because I would need 00 different 00 min writing sessions. That sucks that I was just interrupted by my roommate's phone, because I was about to be on fire. I wonder how many words per minute I've been typing. Pretty good, I'm sure. It's surprising that I haven't mentioned PROPNAME, or PROPNAME I don't give an F about those guys anymore, and I wouldn't be one bit discouraged if I never saw them again. You better believe that. I could have hit those bastards, for the sake of keeping this writing assignment somewhat clean. Anyways, I believe that it will catch up to them someday, and I'm going to let Nature take it's course. I know for a fact that PROPNAME doesn't have anything going for him, I mean he got fired from my friend's dad's restaurant, and then got fired from Subway! Not to knock Subway, but I would expect more out of him, or maybe not. Dom will somehow make an important person feel special, he'll win his or her respect and make a living out of it, but he'll never earn respect from anyone. PROPNAME, I hate to admit, is smart, for now. But oh yeah, it'll catch up. All those drugs are going to bake his head, I can already see it happening. Sure, he's textbook smart, but that won't last for long. Usually, I would wish for their wellbeing, but I have been through far too much. Right now, I seem malicious towards them, but in 0 weeks, I'm sure I just won't care. Has it been 00 minutes, because it feels like about 0 hours. I'm going to check the time, I know, I know, that's cheating, but I HAVE TO! Here I go. I'm back, I've got 0 minutes left. So, there's this kid I used to know from middle school, his name is PROPNAME. He's Iranian, and to my surprise, he's so cool. I'm sorry, that's sounds mean, but this is middle school feelings mixed with high school feelings. He's got PINK hair for crying out loud! And I think he's the only kid that I have ever met able to pull a stunt off like that. I think it suits him, and suits him well. I'm very impressed with how he matured, not to mention his full beard. He actually told me that I used to look more Iranian in middle school, which I think is just crazy. I would say it's the other way around. Basically, he's really cool, and I wish him well. I just hope that he outgrows the not caring much about academics. It's either he doesn't care, or the alarm just went off. Alarm? Oh yeah! I guess I didn't have to check half way through. I don't think I can stop typing, it's like I'm permanently in this stream of consciousness mode, and I really like it. It's like I can express, or spill all of my feelings out, without having to hear feedback. However, feedback would be so beneficial. I'm going to force myself to stop right now. \nAsnwer:"
