No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: welcome to your life, there's no turning back, even while we. we will . whatever. I don't know all the words to everybody wants to rule the world, but that's the song on the radio right now. I can't recall ever hearing a song that I didn't like on ORGNAME. I think that I'll stay in LOCNAME this summer so that I can continue to listen to it. I really missed it last summer, when I didn't really do anything. no, adi can't check his mail. he needs to get his own computer, but then again, so do I. so back to the point, there isn't one, PROPNAME is not impressed with my psychology assignment. he wants to check his mail. that is why he is bitter. he won\u2019t leave me alone to concentrate on my stream of consciousness or however you spell it. PROPNAME is not a man. she is the only girl I've ever met named PROPNAME. PROPNAME will not stop talking about her, I don\u2019t know what his fascination is with her, except that she is very attractive and other things. but that's all I have to say about her, because she is just my very nice friend. I honestly don't care, adi. I\u2019m not lying, I know exactly what my feelings are. adi needs to get the hell out of here. by the way, his real name is aditya, but Americans can't pronounce that. maybe he should go back to LOCNAME. like tonight. I hate the commercials on ORGNAME though. which is why I keep a CD ready for the ten minute commercial times. red shirt PROPNAME, as she's known, was talking about marriage today, I think. that's really scary, since she's only 00, and also because if she marries any one, it should be me. at least for a few days. and PROPNAME hasn\u2019t been around much, but she's kind of out of it anyway. rosy cheeks. PROPNAME has large speakers for his computer. which don't really have any meaning for me, since I never play computer games or do other things with them. I only check my email obsessively, although I usually don't ramble as much, unless I'm emailing my friend PROPNAME, who I tell alot of useless information to. my stream of consciousness is rather boring, as I've learned in past jobs. I've had to entertain myself before while working long hours with no one else around at non engaging tasks. I usually sing whatever song is on my mind until I want to kill myself. (not really-which I should mention since you are psychologists)it's just that these songs get on my mind and won't go away, and all I can do is sing them over and over again. also I sometimes translate them into French. it always seems like I've accomplished something after I've done that. twenty minutes is a long time to just type. at least I have the radio on to give me some sort of stimulation, something to type about. adi has since left the room, which is why what I type is no longer influenced by the things (girls) he is talking about, or rather, about which he is talking. Its hard not to end your sentence with a preposition while typing a stream of consciousness thing, it's also difficult to spell consciousness correctly. I think I need to hear the new Sundays CD, it sounds really good, at least the one song that I've heard from it. I haven't bought a CD in a few weeks now, my last one being an older Poi Dog Pondering CD that I like a lot. my hands are beginning to hurt a little now. fortunately I only have two minutes left. I wonder how many people wrote about how much longer they had left. I know you can type longer, and I'd love to, except I have other homework and my hands hurt in addition to other excuses that I have available. so now I'm going to count to sixty, and that'll be twenty minutes. 00,000. 00,00. 00,00,00,00. that's getting old, although that really was what was going through my mind, only I couldn't really count down and type at the same time, I'll try again with the ten key. 00,000,00,00,00,00,000,00,00,00, no, that takes way too much concentration, but at least now I've exceeded twenty minutes. by one minute. thank you. \nAsnwer:"
