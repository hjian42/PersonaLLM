I wish I could be working on Calculus instead of doing this assignment. I wonder if I am doing this assignment correctly. Do we need to write about what exactly we are thinking, or in question/sentence format. Well I made a decision at the very beginning to write it in sentence format because that is how I have been taught to write at school for so long. I am hungry. I should have made prepared something in the oven, so when I am done with this assignment I would be able to eat it. Now I have started so I must suffer the consequences and be hungry for twenty, or approximately 00 more minutes. I am thinking about what the purpose of this assigment is. I guess it is so you will think about what you are thinking. I want to type things in here as if I was talking to someone, but then again I quickly remember that I am supposed to be writing my stream of consciousness. How fast should I be typing. Should I think about it, then type it, or think about it as I am typing it, or is it a combination of both. Today, I have thought so much about thinking. A new concept entered my mind last night and it is pretty incredible. I can actually get a better grip on my thoughts and thus I am better able to control what I am thinking. This is good because the more control of yourself you have, the more control of every situation you are put in you can then have also. I think that sentence did not make much sense but I know that I know what I am talking about. I am still really hungry. I wonder how many minutes I have to go. Oh, its at the top of the screen, so far I have completed 0 minutes. What else is there to talk about?  I don'e exactly know what Im thinking about right now. wait. ok. . I think I am thinking too hard. Well what would you like me to write about. what I think about really depends on what I am trying to think about. and thinking about thinking seems like it leaves my mind blank. But then again, it is not blank at all. I feel like today was a great day. Everyday that I am alive is a great day. I also think that I worry too much, but when I worry less I have time to think about the things that really matter. But what really matters?  I am soooooooooo hungry. I only have 0 more minutes to go. This writing assignment has to be one of the easiest, requires alot less effort , than most writing assignments. But this assignment is different from all the rest in the fact that I am actually starting to see how this (thinking/ stream of consciousness) works. Once I master it, I feel like I will have accomplished one of the hardest challenges in the world. to find one's self. Ok. . now my stomach is growling. I will be so happy when today is over and I get to lay my head to rest. I am going to appreciate sleeping alot more now that I think about it. It really not only gives your body a break but it also gives your mind a break. Today I feel like my mind has been in overdrive. I have had at least three people tell me I am deep, and I met alot more people today. User's guide. this book sitting right in front of me. I guess I took a break in thinking, and that is what I saw. I am so tired. physically, mentally. I have not pushed myself as much as I did today, and somehow I know it will be for the better. I am so glad that my parent's pushed me to go to college. I think it is an absolutely great/priceless experience that everyone owe's to themselves. Knowledge is power, knowledge about one's self and knowledge about the world are two great tools when your digging through that thing called life. I love that college has brought to my attention some ideas that would have never crossed my mind prior. Well I just looked at the time again and I have approximately 00 more seconds. I ho \nAsnwer:"
