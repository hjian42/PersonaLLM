Although, I am quite bothered that my keybourd is vibrating from all of the bass coming from the neighbor's stereo. I don't know if you know this but you can hear here people talking loudly in the hallways at all hours of the night. All in all college is better than I thought in terms of classes and proffesor, except for calculus. But it is different in terms of people. I just don't fit in with large groups of people well. I'm one to do things in small groups or one on one. I am I guess you could say shy, not so much shy as quiet. I can talk to people I just don't talk a lot. Even my girlfriend whom I've known for a year now. She talks all of the time so it works out. I miss her a lot, more than my family. At my age I was ready to move out from home, but I still haven't adapted to living here yet. I need to start getting more sleep, Ithink I average 0-0 hours of sleep a night. Usually I'm fine except for when I am in classes, just chemistry and Calculus. I want to call to talk to my girlfriend I wqent home to houston and saw her last weekend I have not spoken to her since monday, and I really want to. i have clculus I need to be working on on top of this but it isnot do until wednesday so this assignmnet is more pressing. Sometimes I woory about whether or not I am going to be able to hackk it in some of my classes once we have some tests, chemistry and calculus are pretty hard. I probably chose about the hardest major thjough, Electrical Engineering. I keep on think ing of songs in my head but that can't well be written caan it. I enjoy music, both listening and making music. Playing guitar is one of the major strees relievers for me I do it at least 00 minutes a day now that I am in college I used to only play that much a week. I've been writing more songs now too. I hadn't written any for a while so I hasd a clear fresh mind to work off of. I have been devoting most of my free time to that I guess. I can smell the perfume on a stuffed animal in the room that my girlfriend gave me, she spraid her perfume on it last time I saw her. Few people are really love at this age, I think. I know I am I'm  eighteen years old and I've already met someone who's d I'd love to spend the rest of my life with. She is the first girlfriend I ever had. I'm quite picky when it comes to those sorts of things. I'm suppossed to be meeting new people and building new friendships here at college, supposedly the best times of our lives, I hope that that is wrong. I'm just not socially fit for the college way. Everyone on each floor knows everyone around me, but I don't. And I don't want to I just know that I wouldn't like most of these people, I am also picky about friendships. I don't like just hanging out with people for lack of a better thing to do. I just want to have a feew really good friend, instead of knowing everybodies name and that being it. \nAsnwer:"
