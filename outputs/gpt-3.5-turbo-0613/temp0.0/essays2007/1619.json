Thinking always gets ahead of the recording. Allergy's in the air, uncomfortable contacts. PROPNAME's still here, said he was going to the store. Grammar's gotten lax. Cats on the couch. At least they're not playing. Place is messy-I should clean but I probably won't. Twenty minutes is a rather long time. Is that to get to the truer feelings?  After getting too bored for anything else in 00?  I had a feeling that was the purpose of the 0. 0 hour questionaire. I don't know if I spent 0. 0 hours, but it took forever. And I started the questions too late at night. After answering pages of them I didn't want to back out. Have a   ORGNAME ORGNAME   experiment scheduled Friday. I'm peeved that they didn't give you any idea what you were signing up for. Is it necessary not to fill in the participants?  And my vision isn't 00/00. It's not terribly far from, but I hope they don't check and kick me out. I never use this desk (the one at home) and it's filled with papers and trash that isn't mine. I hate stacks of other people's paper. Filled with cryptic scribbles. I don't feel like I can throw it out, but the odds of it being valuable are pretty slim. Strip Tease with PROPNAME PROPNAME is on cable tonight. I've never seen it, but I watch 00 minutes of it tonight but decided to turn it off. I'm trying to watch less crap tv, but it seems like that's all there is lately. I wonder when the new season starts?  I should try to watch something other than PROPNAME this year. It's easy to get locked into one network if you only see that networks commercials. But if I'm only going to watch one, I guess it should be something other than PROPNAME. My typing has gotten pretty decent. I used to type 00-00 wpm, but typing at work has improved that. Most of my practice though is personal email at work. I waste way too much time online instead of working. It's just so easy with the way my computer faces. I wonder how obvious it is though. I'm rambling, but I feel like I'm suppose to be talking to someone. I say   used   and   supposed  . I'm fairly sure that's wrong (but not sure, which is sad). I always say it, and I can live with that, but I type it too, and can never decide if I should make a change or not. PROPNAME said he was going to the store. I'm paranoid about him reading it for some reason. He just walked up behind me and started to read some, and I asked him not to. It's silly-there's nothing in here that he doesn't already know. And I ramble just like this to him frequently (probably too frequently) and don't have to screen my thoughts much. At least less than with anyone else. But I've always been shy about my writing. I wouldn't even let my parents read the dryest of papers that I wrote, much less one's that were on personal matters. Fish tank in the room, we let moss grow pretty heavily before we bought a cleaning fish. The fish has done a good job though. And it's a good thing we only have neons and guppies, can't kill 'em. Boredom, boredom. Only 0 minutes to go. I wonder how many of these will be read through, and I wonder how many of these wonder how many of these will be read through. Are all people boring like me?  Even witty, entertaining people?  Are there thoughts more exciting?  Does being   on   mean acting like something, not really being one's boring self. Strange itch it my back. I know it's silly, but lately I've felt creaky, like the very mild beginning twinges of getting old. I should excersize. I know I should. I get winded going up a flight of stairs, and I can stand to lost 00 or 00 pounds. I try to diet even though I know the sucess rate from dieting alone (calorie restriction) is dismal. And the PROPNAME's diet thing. Although it evidently works for many people, it's obviously targeted diet in my opinion. That may not be fair, but from my own observations women are much more likely to eat a carbohydrate based diet, while men like to get more calories from meat. PROPNAME calls a carbohydrate diet unnatural and unhealthy. And that's ludicrious. Perhaps his diet is healthy, but it doesn't follow that the other is not. Only five seconds left, does the timer stop by itself?  Went over time, but couldn't resist finishing the sentance. Shave and a hair cut, two bits.        \nAsnwer:"
