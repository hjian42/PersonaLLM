No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: well I am sitting here in my bed just before 00 AM on a thursday morning writing out a  conscious stream of my thoughts. my girlfriend is coming to see me this weekend and I'm  excited about that, as well as the fact that my best friend is going back home for the weekend  and leaving his apartemnt at my disposal. an apartment is a much better place to stay with  your girlfriend than any god-forsaken dormatory, especially since my room mate will be here. football game saturday agains ORGNAME, and I love my football. I've always loved college football  and now that I get to go and watch my team, one of the best in the nation, play is a great  experience for me, on that I will enjoy greatly for the next few years. speaking of which, I'm  pretty hacked off that I was unaware that you had to purchase tickets to the OU game  seperately, and more than that, that there was no obvious information on the season ticket  website about this. I'm getting back into the flow of school again, and most of my classes seem  like they will be rather easy, assuming that I read the material and pay attention in class, which I  might add is tough to do on a regular basis. I've havent attended a single calculus study  session which greatly frees up my tuesdays and thursdays, having only one class in the late  afternoon. I love not having to write with proper punctuation and capitalization. the  experiment in class the other day was very interesting. I personally though lie detectors were a  bunch of crap, but the psychological side of them is pretty interesting. I wouldn't mind doing a  psychological study of poker players and how they interact while playing hold 'them, etc. Some of  the calls they make about other peoples hands are simply amazing. what makes someone fold  a good hand?  what makes a person be able to win on a bluff?  these are interesting events to  me. but anyways, I wish I didn't have any homework this weekend, as a matter of fact I need to  finish reading chapter three in my psyc book, I'll attend to that after I finish writing this. hmmmm, what else, oh yeah. last night I played with four of my friends in a pick up game at  the gym. the first game we won, the second game we won, and the third game we lost by one  shot to a team led by a steriod, testosterone-over pumped crazy kid who was a complete jerk. it's interesting that everyone on my team was pissed off, except for me. they are normally the  ones who tell me to chill out cause I get mad and stuff. I sort of miss dallas and my girl, but I  know that we're both very committed and that she loves me a lot. she's a great girl and I'd hate  to have to do all this without her, although I wish she was at ORGNAME, that would make things  much, much easier. I'm really hungry, I wish this timer would hurry up, I need to shave, wash  my face, brush my teeth, eat something, finish reading, do some homework, and study for a  quiz I have tomorrow in economics. I hope that quiz won't be too hard. I'll just have to  memorize the stuff in the book such as the expendeture approach to GDP, which is that  GDP=C+I+G+(I'M-EX). wow, I'm really glad I can remember that and I havent even studied yet,  but the income approach is a little harder, even though I know I can get that easily if I just study  it for a little while. will thanks for the time, my 00 are up. bye. \nAsnwer:"
