I wanted to get it done before I forgot. I hate when I forget to do homework. Most of it is pretty easy but I just have bad memory sometimes. I write things down now in a little blue spiral that fits in my back pocket. I like to write down things in there that I feel are necessary to remember. Today I watched a movie called  The Rules of Attraction \". It was cool. It was meant to be one of those \"teen movies\" but it told things on a more real basis. Most teen movies end with happy endings and the main characters fall in love. Life is not like that always though. It consisted of a big love triangle that went terribly wrong. I cannot spell very well. I like microsoft Word because it makes those wavy red lines underneath words that I screwed up on. My computer is making a funny noise. My head hurts. I am running out of ideas to write about. 0 minutes 00 seconds. Still a while to go. I get my braces off in 0 days. I cannot wait. If you have never had braces, take it from me, they suck. Imagine not being able to smile for one year. It sucks really bad. I like music. My roommate is playing some music on his computer right now. He was playing a cool song but he turned it off and is playing something crappy. I told him to change it back but he did not. Now he did. Sweet. 0 min 0 seconds. Still a while to go. When I started this I did not know how much I could write in 00 minutes. I can remember assignments in high school that I would write in under 00 minutes. I really had an easy time in high school. It was fun. My school was small nothing like it is here. I lived in Little Elm, LOCNAME, which is in the dallas area. I liked it there but PROPNAME is so much better. I want to go to school here and finish my major (kinesiology) and go to graduate school in LOCNAME. I really want to check that place out. Most people that go to school here have become Longhorn fans but I have been a fan as long as I can remember. That is cool and all but it just seems like they go to games and like the team just because they are wining. I can remember seasons where the ORGNAME would win only 0 games. It sucked but you have to stick with a team. My roommate is asking me how to work the dvd player in the living room. I wonder if the teacher is actually going to read this. That was funny how that kid did not even write anything he just pasted something on the screen. good times. 00 min 00 sec. Today is Wednesday. 0/0/00. September 00 is coming up again. I read on the internet that 0/00 was a drug deal gone bad with PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. Heroin is a major export out of the LOCNAME LOCNAME. The LOCNAME Gov't controls the drug flow weather we like to believe it or not. Heroin was the largest import into the LOCNAME LOCNAME in 0000. I bet you did not know that. Something went wrong so terrorist attacked us. I wonder if the truth will ever come out. PROPNAME is a moron. If I ever saw him I would call him that. I would probably say f-ing moron. I hope he would get mad. I do not like him. I also believe he is a member of illuminati. One the one dollar bill, there is a picture of a triangle with and eye in it. The eye is a symbol that represents the devil's eye. Also in bar codes, there are three lines that represent 000. That kind of shows how evil money is and everything we buy we are supporting the devil. These are just some crazy conspiracy theories I believe. I also believe that we have not been to the moon. Woogie from borrington high. Sorry my roommate is watching Something About Marry and that is a line from it. Have you seen my baseball. 00 min 00 secs. I am getting close. So what up. I rented two movies from blockbuster. I am hungry. after I am done with this I will eat. No eat. eat eat eat. I like to eat. This is getting boring. I am almost done though. It is almost time to go. I got really drunk on Friday night and threw up in front of the building we have this class. I tried to walk home from the fraternity houses. I made it to the stadium and passes out. Eventually my roommate picked me up. It was good times. And I am done \nAsnwer:"
