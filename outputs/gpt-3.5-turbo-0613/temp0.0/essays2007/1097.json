I don't know why I don't really want to go to bed. I guess I just don't feel like it or I feel like I have to do something before I go to bed, but then something else pops up. I think I got used to not sleeping during my time in the ORGNAME. Kind of fun back then. The ORGNAME usually pops in my head late at night when I'm on the computer because that's what I did in the ORGNAME. I can tune everything out and just have the humming of the computer and only the light from the screen providing light for the room. Reminds me of sitting in the track at 0 or 0am shooting missions. I wonder where I would be if I would have stayed in. I bet I would have gone to LOCNAME for a year then back to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I wish I would have gone to LOCNAME as soon as I got out of AIT. Those guys came back better trained than the guys who stayed in the LOCNAME. I probably could have used that year being away from everybody. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. Man I hate the rain. I remember in LOCNAME I missed all the rainy days at school. I guess I got lucky it only seemed to rain on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I miss LOCNAME. The leaves, the snow, the mountains and the lake right behind the apartment. Man, everyday there was football weather. I can't believe they lost to ORGNAME last week. Man I hate ORGNAME. \nAsnwer:"
