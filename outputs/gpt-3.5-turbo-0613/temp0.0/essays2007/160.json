I wonder how long 00 minutes really is and how much I can write. time always seems to go by so slow when I\u2019m bored out of my mind. it's too quiet in this room. usually there's people constantly talking, walking in and out, shouting, banging, or anything to cause distraction. you see, I\u2019m in my cousin frank's room. well, we're not really blood cousins, just cousins by marriage- his aunt married my uncle. anyway, he's pretty cool. I hated him when I was a kid. we were in the same Chinese class and he was one of those really annoying, obnoxious boys that always teased the girls. I guess we're pretty close now. it was pretty scary finding out we were cousins, but its fun calling each other that. ugh. I\u2019m so bored. the only noise I hear is the humming of the a/c which is right above the desk. it's hot, and the a. c. 's not cool enough to keep me comfortable. I\u2019m really paranoid about frank's room. he's a pretty messy guy, and someone just came in here complaining that there were fleas in here. yuck. I hate bugs of any shape and size. all I know is that I\u2019m beginning to feel itchy everywhere. man, it's only 0:00 now. about half way through this writing assignment. laddy PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. I don't know what to write. the more I sit here, the more impatient I get and the more paranoid I am about these bugs around me. frank lives inside an Asian fraternity house. I\u2019m not trying to say Asians are dirty, but sometimes the guys do get a little lazy. I wish they'd clean up a bit. even right after the clean, it's still a mess. it smells moldy, the lighting is really bad, the air is thick, and it just feels nasty walking in here. I hate taking showers or going to the bathroom here. the dim lights are constantly flickering, the seats are a dingy yellow/brown color, and it stinks like shit. and the one stall that's actually half way decent has no lights in it. I basically take a shower in the dark. and the worst part is that I paranoid about guys walking in and out of the bathroom while I\u2019m in there changing. all the guys here know me and respect my boyfriend, but it's just the thought of guys there. yes. it's 0:00. and frank and my friend PROPNAME just got back. they're starting their own racing crew and just picked up stickers for their cars. mmm. and they brought back food. even though I don't like ORGNAME, I always crave it when I smell it. oh well, I\u2019m just gonna eat some since my time's up. yeah! \nAsnwer:"
