My boyfriend is picking me up and we are going to drive back to LOCNAME. I am excited about going home. My suite mate is also going home this weekend. That is fun. Her parents don't want her to come back so soon. In one way I don't really want to go home either. I am going because I will get to spend time with my boyfriend. His name is PROPNAME-by the way. My room mate is sleeping. I kinda feel bad about typing while she is sleeping, but I have things I need to get done. One of those things involves typing. She has been really mood lately as far as people being quite. She needs to understand that living with three people is hard. I have PROPNAME from PROPNAME on my desk. I got her from my boyfriend. I collected all of the ORGNAME's toys. I had all the characters from LOCNAME except PROPNAME. I don't remember why I mentioned that to him, but he went to an Antique store and found PROPNAME!  It was really sweet. He gave it to me when I was sick. We have a really good relationship. It is really hard being away from him. We have only been dating for three months, but we have spent every hour of every day of those three months together. There was only one day we spent apart. He went to his dad's house. He went there early in the morning. I was really tired that day. I don't remember what I did but I was tired after. It was a long day with out him. I think my friends started to feel neglected because I was spending so much time with PROPNAME. Most of them understood. I did make time for them-but just not as much time as  I was spending with them before PROPNAME and I were together. My friend PROPNAME and I got into a big fight because I was spending so much time with PROPNAME. That was part of the problem. The other part of it was that she stopped taking her Prozac. Bad move. She really upset me. We going in a fight at 0rd period and I was crying at 0th. I went to talk to a friend of both mine and PROPNAME's about the situation. PROPNAME showed up and started yelling at me even more. I was none too happy. PROPNAME told me that PROPNAME was under alot of stress because of family problems and other things. I didn't understand why she couldn't be happy for me. Jonathan was my first real boyfriend. PROPNAME has gone through many. I am always happy and supportive of them and her relationships. For once I wish she could do the same for me. It has all worked out now and PROPNAME and I have talked. We are friends again. That is good. I hate it when people are mad at me. I do not do well with enemies. My mommy always taught me to never make enemies. I still call my mom mommy. I don't know why. It is just one of those things. One of PROPNAME's friends would tease me about that. That's OK. I'm well over that!  I have my next class at 0-0. I don't know what I will do until then. I think I might do some of my work-but that is not likely. I think I will return some e-mail and stare at the walls. I'm good at that!  It's my hobby, next to sleeping!  Until next time I have to type-I think I will go now!   \nAsnwer:"
