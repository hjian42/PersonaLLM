No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: A writing assignment that lasts twenty minutes doesn't seem like a difficult task, but as I sit here I can remember all the papers that I have written. I usually sit and stare at my computer or take breaks to read what I have written before I continue. I can imagine that this paper will ramble and go into amazingly different subjects. Right now I'm thinking about where I need to go to get on the bus to go to my boyfriend's apartment. I wanted him to come pick me up, but he didn't want to. I looked up the campus loop bus schedule and the metro bus schedule and my mind is just going over and over the maps, trying to figure the best routes to take. Today is in fact my second day ORGNAME school at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. I was initially excited to begin classes and leave home and not be in high school. Now, I'm more worried that I won't be able to succeed like I did in high school. Maybe I'm not so worried that I won't do well; I'm worried that it will be very hard and that I won't be able to pass the finals, which appear to be the biggest part of most grades. Today my chemistry professor said that any chemistry majors should not be in the class. Well, I'm not a chemistry major, but I am a biochemistry major, so now I'm worried that I'm in the wrong class. I've consulted the course schedule several times already to make sure I'm eligible for the class, and it appears that I am. Maybe I just shouldn't worry. I also worry that my professors will yell at me or tell me to leave the room. I'm basically a good student, and I usually don't disrupt the class. Sometimes, though, its hard to sit still and be quiet when you are sitting miles away from a professor and you are surrounded by other people that you are friends with. I guess its not really a big deal, but I don't like getting in trouble. I'm one of those people who likes to do things I'm not allowed to do, like drink, but once I suspect that someone might find out, I'll try to get everyone else to stop. I know it is kind of hypocritical, but I just don't like to get in trouble. The words I dreaded most growing up were \"LOCNAME, we need to talk. \" Whenever my mother said that to me, I just knew I had to be in trouble. I would spend my time raking my brain, trying to figure out what I did that she found out about that she doesn't approve of. Usually, it turned out to be nothing. I guess sometimes I worry about things that once left alone will turn out all right. About a month before going to college, I spent a day stressed and crying because all these things needed to be done. I guess I wasn't getting enough sleep and that made me more anxious or nervous, but I was crying about everything. It even made me upset that I didn't have my computer yet, and I wasn't leaving for college for another month. I just wanted to get my computer and make sure that everything worked and looked how I wanted it to. Plus I had a lot of things to do in August, and I didn't want to run out of time. It did work out, but I still became upset about it. I moved from worrying about my computer, which works fine, to worrying about my career. For the past couple of years, I've told everyone that I want to be a doctor. Now I'm thinking about how much school, and how much money that will cost. I can't even begin to imagine the debt that I will incur by trying to become a doctor. That made me want to look into other careers, but I don't like a lot of other things. Maybe I can wait until I graduate to worry about that, but that wouldn't suit my personality very well. I like to worry about everything. What I really like to do though, is to make lists. I love buying planners because I always write down my assignments. And I write what I have to do on Thursday and if I don't finish that day, I write it again on Friday to make sure I do it. I'm not that concerned if I don't complete my tasks, but I just want to make a list. My roommate just walked in and was mentioning how we haven't seen much of each other. I have been spending a lot of time at my boyfriend's apartment, but don't most people enjoy some time to their selves? Plus, my roommate likes to have complete silence when she studies, and I want to have music playing. It wouldn't be so bad, but she studies all the time. I understand about being a good student, but this course is so familiar to her she could have placed out. I guess I'm just used to studying if I need to in order to do well. I just can't understand people that have or want to study all the time. \nAsnwer:"
