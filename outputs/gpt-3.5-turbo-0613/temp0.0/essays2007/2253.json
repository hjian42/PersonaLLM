I was in a shock when I found out that this was due tomorrow. Deadlines motivate me more than ever. I told myself that I was going to do this earlier or on some sleepless night but I guess getting it done is what is most important. I just played some Starcraft with my roommate. I used to play this game with all my friends from school before War Craft III came out for the computer. This game ruined any chances for me to finish my homework. I'd have to say this game was the devil. It made my parents really mad when they would walk into my room and find me playing in the middle of the game. I told them I would shut it off after that game but it was too addicting. My parents somehow figured out that I started a new game and threatened to throw my computer out. This wasn't a very good feeling. Well, anyway, this girl from high school asked me to go to the homecoming dance with her less than 00 hours ago. Somehow, all of my friends managed to find out in that amount of time. This was extremely strange because I didn't tell anybody about this news. I tried asking them where they heard this gossip but they refused to answer my questions. This aggravated me just a little bit because my curiosity was at its peak. A few friends from LOCNAME already know. I mean, what's the big deal. I don't understand why gossip can travel so fast. I guess it is because everyone wants to become involved in other people's lives. I think this knowledge makes them feel superior to others. I find myself talking on instant messenger and the opening statement would be \"what's up\". The basis of a conversation is what is going on with the other person's life. This type of conversation doesn't really achieve much but it makes you feel like you belong. Figuring gossip about yourself is a strange thing. You never know who's watching and points out the smallest detail to tell another person. I figured my actions didn't speak THAT loud. But any kind of gossip sparks a conversation like no other. It immediately captures the center of attention. I think people should be more concerned about figuring who they are. This is not an easy task. Starting college this year has sure caused a lot of changes. Changes in friendship, responsibility and so on. College is a good way of determining who your real friends are. These are truly hard to find. I knew this girl that had about 0 parties a year. There would be over fifty people over at her house and she seemed to be enjoying their company. But one time at lunch I saw her sitting by herself and she was by herself for a little while today too. It's crazy how things can turn right around like that. Well my hall is being pretty loud right now playing music or what not. My friendship with existing friends have sure been tested and I think that the conversation we had strengthened our relationship. We hardly ever talk about serious matters, so this was refreshing to me. I hang out with a bunch of guys that aren't really open to their feelings. We seem like a bunch where we tell each other everything but we know that we're just buddies. I mean we'll be there for the other person in a heartbeat but no one really knows what the other is thinking, especially about relationships. We'd always give one of the guys a hard time because we found out who he liked or what not. I always thought that we would support them and tell them to do what he felt. But this was never the case. Three out of the four guys go to school here in LOCNAME but the fourth person is in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I can tell he really misses the guys from high school and all of his gaming friends. Everyone makes fun of him about his intelligence but I feel obliged to back him up. I know it's all in fun but after a while I think it's just mean. I miss the guy too. I hope he makes it to LOCNAME next year. \nAsnwer:"
