I have a nervous feeling in my stomach probably because I am going to meet a guy that I've had a crush on this friday. I am kind of upset that my friend from chicago hasn't called me. I am also nervous about the semester, because I am hoping to bring up my ORGNAME since I didn't do so well, last year. My second year and already I feel like my classes  are just going to give me a lot of trouble. I'm still on basics and at times I feel dumb because I should already be in my upper division courses. I am motivated again to do well and I feel that everything I am doing so far is going to get me to where I want to be. I have exercised, studied, relaxed, etc. What else do I need to achieve my goal. I want to get into med-school and become a doctor. But, I also want to finish as soon as possible. I miss my family, but I don't miss the rules that they give me. My parents are good parents, don't get me wrong, but I still disagree with a lot of the rules. I guess everyone raises their kids differently. But in a way they have me scared. Scared, to go out to clubs with my friends, or parties or any other social activity that happens at night. Mainly because they would always tell me that it wasn't me they didn't trust it  was the \"people out there\"  So, that freaks me out and whenever I do go to clubs or anything I'm always paranoid that someone is going to have a gun and just start shooting. Or an even worse thought is that I might somehow get hit by a drunk driver. Whatever happens in the world that makes the news and freaks out my parents is what I'm afraid of. Maybe, that's how they wanted it. I'm still a pleasant person to hang out with, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I just worry too much. Back to the feeling tired bit, well this past weekend I went home for my sisters birthday. It was a surprise. She gave me a big hug. And it made me feel really good, because me and my sister are always fighting. And going away to college has brought us closer. She is 00 and I'm 00 so it's a big age difference. Anyway I went to her party that my parents had for her and I slept about 0 hrs. the entire weekend. I got home Monday morning and slept all day. And about being nervous well, sometimes I always have that feeling. And usually I can explain it, but there are times when I don't know why. I like this guy PROPNAME from LOCNAME, the one who hasn't  called. And since I've met him, I can't seem to stop talking about him. I catch myself talking about him as though he's made a big impact on my life. And really he hasn't. So far everyone I've met has heard about him and my roommates are tired of it. But I can't help it, so lately for everyone's sake I've been keeping quiet and trying to talk about other things, but I still have him on my mind. \nAsnwer:"
