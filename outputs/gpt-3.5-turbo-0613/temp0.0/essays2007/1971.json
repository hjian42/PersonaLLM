No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: This is different, I always thought stream of consciousness was a writing style, I never knew it had a basis in psychology. Should I used punctuation, I don't think my thoughts are punctuated. These must be horribly boring to read, the most eclectic thought process and there is that annoying girl with loud voice. And my girlfriend wants to read these, but I don't want her to, she didn't listen to me, how rude. She never listens, just constantly does what she wants, and complains. If she reads this now, she will be understandably upset. We moved down to LOCNAME together from ORGNAME ORGNAME in LOCNAME and its been more stressful than I had imagined. I was the impetus behind our transfer and feel some guilt whenever she doesn't enjoy something, and constantly want her to have a great time, even though I share some of her misgivings. Although I have to say the campus is great, the school is good, and I enjoy going to class; however, ORGNAME did not match up to my expectations. Its a tier one school and I expected more, I can detect little difference between here and Northeastern, except Northeastern has more money. Do we compare our writings at the end of the year and look at how are thoughts have changed as we have become more integrated into the school?  I hope not, I hope there is some more interesting point to this class. Or maybe, this class will give me a greater ability to analyze the writing which will lead to a deeper understanding of my self. My girlfriend is so stubborn she takes so long to come to the obvious conclusions. She can't study because of the loud girl with the annoying voice and I told her to go to the library and I would join her in twenty minutes, but no, she would rather suffer. Maybe she knows I feel guilty when she does not enjoy something and wants to punish me in some way, or maybe she just wants to be near me. Or maybe she is afraid of change. I heard yawns signal the body is preparing for a change in action or state of being, maybe that is accurate, never heard that before and it doesn't occur in all situations. I did an internship at Northeastern and I hated it, that made me focus a lot more on school. I was always disorganized and rarely put effort into school, after that experience however, I want to get the best grades I can and the widest range of academic experience. I feel that the more ways I learn of analyzing a situation, the more thought processes, the better I will be able to deal with the real world  and whatever I want to do. Mostly right now I want to be a trader, a hedge fund manager, be wealthy. Predominately to have security and independence. Not have to worry about work and do whatever I enjoy. I think that would be economics, write essays on economics, and that ties in with trading and hedge funds, so it is not far. I also am interested in politics and think about running for congress. This paper clearly alters my thought process, I don't lay myself out every time I think, it has an artificial quality to it. Although, in class you said one way to deal with depression and change was to right about it, maybe this homework assignment is a self-help exercise. How come women care more about the personal life and thoughts of other people than men, in general, not every woman. I assume that someone else wants privacy and to be treated with respect but women always want to know what is going on and pry into it. People are interesting to watch though, but there is a lot of commonality in all human actions. People tend to do similar activities, not exact activities, but similar. Groups of people tend to act in similar fashions. That loud girl left, its so much quieter here. I don't know when I am going to graduate, but Ill have 00 credits after this term, and six months of an internship experience, crazy. At some point I need to graduate, that'll be exciting but nerve racking. I'm mostly worried about paying bills and saving for retirement and college for children. Its insane I worry about that, I'm 00, not 00. But being interested in finance makes me think about that now, and how important the first few years in and after college are. Since money in the stock market will double roughly every 0. 0 years on average, its important to start early for retirement. What about all the people in less developed countries, specifically third-world countries. We should do more to help them, humanity only has itself to support it, we shouldn't exploit each other. I wonder what the world would be like if people were able to look beyond the immediate future and into the next 00-00 years. They would see its in their best interest to help those less fortunate. Ending slavery and instituting a minimum wage has caused real wealth to increase, not decrease and society is more stable. Imagine how much better the world would be if everyone had a stable society, could go to college, contribute to humanity and become consumers. There would be more technological advancements, real wealth would increase faster, I'm sure we would find new problems, but things would be better. I'm not sure multilateralism is the answer, institutions do impinge upon our sovereignty, but they are better than a single hegemonic power trying to control the world. There aren't any attractive girls in here, besides my girlfriend. I wonder what that says about the business school atrium at 0 o'clock on a wednesday. Not a happening spot perhaps?  Although there a ton of people here for the cash flow casino. 00 minutes, sweet, I can do other homework. See you Friday. \nAsnwer:"
