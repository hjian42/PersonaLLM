I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester. I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I don't want to wake up early tomorrow. Maybe I won't be tired. I probably will. I wish PROPNAME would hurry up and call me. I get tired of waiting. I need to do homework for math, but I don't really know how. I also don't want to go to Spanish tomorrow. I want my mom to buy me a new cell phone. I'm very glad this week is almost over. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll be very busy, but I'll have a lot of fun. I really hope that the guy I called today about buying his puppy doesn't sell it before I can have enough money to buy it. I'm so full. I shouldn't have eaten so much dinner. I hope my friend PROPNAME isn't mad at me for not calling her back for two weeks. I really don't want to go to school anymore. I wish I was married to a professional athlete or something. I'm very tired today even though I got plenty of sleep last night. My mom is so nice, but she gets so annoying sometimes. I feel really bad for being rude to her sometimes, but she treats me like I am in junior high sometimes. Probably because I'm the baby and she misses all her kids. I wish she would get a job or something so that she'd have something to do since my dad's never there for her. Maybe PROPNAME is home and he's calling me but he can't get hold of me because I am on the computer. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than you'd think. I don't think I have ever typed for twenty minutes straight before. The computer even thinks so. Now I'm going to have to resign online for the tenth time. Very annoying. I really just want to crawl into my bed right now. I would much rather sleep than do my homework but I guess I had better do my homework so I don't ruin my ORGNAME. Even though I'm sure it won't be as high this semester as last year. Oh well, it's not really my fault. I really don't think all that much in my head I don't believe because I am running out of things to type. I wish that I was in the Caymans with all of my friends right now. That would be so much fun. Maybe over Christmas or something. I think that not everyone could afford it though. I am so glad that I am still on my parents' payroll. I would be nowhere without it. I can't believe some people have to pay for their tuition and things like that. I couldn't imagine, but then again most of them are married or have babies or both. I definitely could not imagine that either. I wish I could stay this age or younger forever. Preferably a freshman in college. I really didn't realize how much fun I was having until I had to grow up a year. I hope that I am doing this assignment correctly. I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester.
