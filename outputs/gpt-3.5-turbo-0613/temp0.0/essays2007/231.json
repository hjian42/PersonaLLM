I really don't know what I'm supposed to write but I guess I'll start anyway while I have some free time. I don't know if we're supposed to word wrap this thing or not so forgive me for the  excessive going out of the lines. I just barely made it here to the Ugl and decided  \"why not and just do my homework while I have time. \"  Today in Psych class it was  pretty boring. I just wish we did something a little more interesting. I took this class because an old girlfriend/friend recommended taking this class. She  told about her Psych class and how interesting it was. So far I like the class  but I wish we could start on some interesting facts. I still haven't bought my  Psych book and I hope I can hang on for one more day. I'm really just worried  about whether my financial aid is coming in. I also miss home already. I decided  not to go home over the holidays so I could stay here and hang out with my friends. But I think I made the wrong decision. Even though I came during the summer I still miss  home. For that whole month in the summer of 00 I just thought about going home. I was in the preview program for the summer but I don't regret being in that program. I met some of the coolest people during the summer than I have my whole  entire life. My old friends seem like dumb asses when compared to the ones I met. I just wish I didn't feel so insecure About Math. I hate Math. I used to be good in it when I was in Jr. High and the beginnings of my high school life. But during my Jr. and Sr. year I really slacked off and got my first C's from my  Pre-cal class and my Calculus class. That's one of the reasons I came during the  summer so I could take Pre-cal. That was one of the worst Classes I have ever taken. I got my first D in the summer and my dad wasn't to happy. He graduated from ORGNAME  and he wants me to do the same. I'll try not to disappoint him but I don't know  what the future holds for me. I just wish I wasn't in a major that required taking a  math class. But I hope I get an A average this fall. I better. I just need to work more smarter and know and learn how to study better. Plus I have a work study job now and I hope that doesn't drag me down. I guess It's almost been twenty minutes but  I still got about three more minutes to go . It's weird but I didn't think I could type for a solid twenty minutes without stopping for  a five minute rest or something. One ting I know right now is that I am starving. That damn job is costing me my  lunch. I think I have to start packing a lunch every time I go to work. I need to  buy meal replacement bars when I get my first paycheck. I just hope it's more than a hundred dollars. I forgot but I need to call my dad and ask about the financial aid. I guess I'll call him tonight and maybe he could sort out things. I feel so tired. I just want to go back home and sleep for ever. But I know that wouldn't be the wise thing to do. College sucks. I just wish things came a lot more easier to me. I have no more thoughts. I am just stuck here typing on a computer. Well I better  go eat now and hope that I typed enough for this assignment. One down and one to go. I guess I'll see you in class. Bye. \nAsnwer:"
