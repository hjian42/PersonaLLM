I have tried so many times to go to the Internet site for this class, and it says error. The URL. I am upset. This thing is due Friday. So now I'm in word, waiting for the stupid site to be fixed. I just got off the phone and the conversation made no sense. There was a party in the town I am from, and some guy got stabbed and died. He was 00 and from LOCNAME LOCNAME. The weird thing is that no one knows who stabbed him. Now to me this makes no sense. They were at a PARTY. There are usually people everywhere. Oh well. I have a lot of stuff to do. Me and PROPNAME are going apartment hunting tomorrow. ItORGNAME weird, I've only known her since I moved here in August, and already we are good friends and plan on living together next year. We want to live at ORGNAME ORGNAME because it's cute. I looked on the Internet for some info on it, and there is none. I think it is stupid that we have to go apartment shopping in September for a place we won't move into for almost a year. Oh well, we are doing it now so we don't get screwed. I was just talking to PROPNAME, my cute boyfriend, and I was telling him about the pleasure center in mice and how different it was from humans. I always tell him what I've learned in class because it helps me remember it. I feel sorry for him, I wouldn't want to hear it if I were him. He's so nice like that. I ordered cookies last night from ORGNAME's ORGNAME, they deliver freshly cooked cookies to your door. Anyway, I was in a friend's room at PROPNAME PROPNAME I hate and we were talking about boyfriends and stuff. I told them I want to get married on November 00, 0000 to PROPNAME. They laughed and asked why, so I told them. We've actually talked about marriage, and we both love each other that much, so it's cool. We want to live together in a couple of years. Actually he is going to live near us at LOCNAME LOCNAME if at all possible. He has a brother who is a year younger, PROPNAME, who is a pothead. He has a girlfriend PROPNAME, who I don't like. She's only a freshman in high school, but she doesn't belong with him. PROPNAME and PROPNAME are total opposites. I have a lot of work to do. Tonight I have to do calculus, read for my freshman seminar, and do my Italian work. I got a quiz back today from that class, and I got a 00. I was so upset. I'm used to A's. Italian is not a required course for my major, so I was wondering if I could take it pass/fail. That would be good, then it couldn't bring down my ORGNAME. I need to ask some one about that. I hate my roommate and suitemate. They are so damn loud. PROPNAME, the suitemate has people over now who are very loud. I like it quite, but that doesn't happen here at ORGNAME ORGNAME. I went through rush this year and got a bid from A Chi O, but I decided not to pledge. I am glad I didn't because they are out all of the time, and I'm taking 00 hours this and every other semester. I want to finish in three years, so I have to take 00 hours every semester, and 0 in each summer session. That's cool with me though, since I don't feel really comfortable here. My dad is an accountant for the LOCNAME LOCNAME, in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. We don't have the major bucks, which is totally opposite from the girls that live here. We aren't poor by any means. I have a 0000 Eclipse which my dad got me for my birthday last year. My brother is premed here at LOCNAME. Actually, he's supposed to graduate in December. He took an extra semester to take some business courses. He's really smart, but he likes to party. He was a LOCNAME, and that is just a synonym for partier. I don't like to party much at all. If I didn't have PROPNAME, I'd probably party, but I'm just not compelled to get drunk on Friday and Saturday and spend Sunday recuperating. That is not my idea of a good time. It used to be though. My sophomore year, I was the party queen. I have never done drugs in my life. No pot, coke, or anything. I did drink a lot, but I don't anymore. The last time I got drunk was a \"Roundup\" in April. I threw up on my own shoe. Needless to say, I don't do that anymore. PROPNAME has never been drunk before. He's so innocent to meet, but only I know the \"real\" him. I think that's cool. I just got an email from my exboyfriend. We dated for almost a year and a half, but I had to break up with him because I liked PROPNAME more. Me and PROPNAME will have been together for 00 months on 000000. He's so wonderful. I'm obsessed with him, which is okay by me. I'd do anything for him. My birthday is the day of the LOCNAME game. My family is coming down and so is PROPNAME (he's only a senior). We are planning on going to LOCNAME's on the Bend, which is one of my absolute favorite places ever. We ate at the ORGNAME on Friday. We got lost, but it was still fun. I was so scared when we got to my brother's house. He lives on the east side of 00 which is really scary. We were trying to unlock the door, and a car parked across the street and watched up get in. \nAsnwer:"
