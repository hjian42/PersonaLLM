No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: OK so right about now I'm thinking about what a great and interesting assignment this is . I am also thinking about all the stuff covered during the last classs about the brain I can actually see my brain working, with all that left and right functioning stuff. My thoughts are now drifting a bit becasue the phone just rang but it was for my roomate. Now I'm thinking about this one girl I sat next the last couple of classes we were usually arow or two apart but man I really thinkshe is  beautiful. I hope to sit right next to her this upcoming class and start up a conversation or something. I hope she likes me, I'm nervous as all hell. Ok now I'm thinking about all the stuff I have to do today. After this assignment ill probably ask someone to do my laundry, then ill do some english and chem and of course the dreadful calculus. My sensations are somewhat jumbled I feel kinda depressed just because I have been looking for a girlfriend for so long and can't find the right one. I feel like I have so much love to give but noone to give it to. Also I really miss my friends from home in LOCNAME antonio. there are about three girls I have my eye on right about now. this one girl I went to camp texas with whose name is PROPNAME, that girl from psychology class, and this girl I have been in love with for about a year( but she is in LOCNAME LOCNAME and has a boyfriend) ,  I usually think about her every hour of th eday and dream about her like four days out of the week. Yeah I reallly miss PROPNAME a lot. sometimes I see myself kicking that boyfirens ass but then I think about how upset it would make PROPNAME. Almost everything I do is to show her that I am better thatn that loser of hers. Iv'e never met anyone remotely similar to PROPNAME, one of a kind. Oh well I got to stop thinking about it or ill end up in tears again. anyways I really can't wait till September 00 because this band that is from my home town in san LOCNAME LOCNAME is finally putting out a CD and it comes out that day. This band(Sublime) is actually old but the lead singer died in 00 of an overdose and the band members finally got over the death and decided they ow it to him to keep playing,  there motto was long live the Sublime sound. there sound is like a mix of a lot of Reagae, punk, hip hop, and some spanish stuff in there to. So since they were going to need a knwe lead singer, they got a long time friend of the band , PROPNAME PROPNAME, a tatoo artist from Southern CALI, to sing. There new name is \"Long Beach Dub ALL Atars\"  I could go on and on about hte history of this band and what is goung on but it would get crazy and who ever reads this would think in crazy, good thing noone is going to read it. That would kinda be crapy if anyone read this becasue they would be like reading my mind or something. I just found out I have three minutes left and I wish I could stihere and do this all day for real m like in a zone or somrething. right now I'm stumped I don't think me mind is moving at all, I'm ust thinking about hitting the right key. I feel like typing out the lyrics to the song Badfish right now becasue they are about love afor a girl and for the beach and ocean and the su, and big reefs underwater, god and all these things that ust hit me hard.    \nAsnwer:"
