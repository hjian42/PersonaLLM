I don't mean to say finally with such a relief, but my head is just pounding from her music!  I really like her a lot, we get along great, we just don't have the same taste in almost anything. now, I'm not a neat freak, but living in such a small place for the next nine months, I would kind of like to keep the room picked up. I don't think she feels the same way!  this morning, she ate cheerios, but threw most of them away, so our room smelled like rotten cheerios all morning. she finally threw them away, it's not so bad. I think some of her habits and ways come hand in hand with the fact that she is an art major. I don't mean to be stereotypical, it just seems that the artist in her contributes to her taste in many things. twenty minutes sure is a long time to write!  that could also be because I'm not much of a writer. I used to like to write for fun, when I was younger, but being forced to do things makes me tend to not enjoy them as much. now, this is not so bad because I'm not worried about correct spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc. , so I sure hope those things don't matter!  I can't believe I waited until three hours before the due date to do this paper. actually, I can, I am such a procrastinator. I think it is the worst feature about myself. especially now in college, when there really is no time for procrastination. there always seems to be some sort of studying or reading I could be doing, but then again, there are a million other things that are just so much more appealing and at the time seem to be just as important as that homework!  like for instance, it would almost be a sin to not see the final episode of my favorite tv show, or to miss out on what the rest of my friends are doing!  only three other girls I went to high school with came to UT this year, and two of them live right across the hall!  it's so strange how things work out. speaking of strange things, I saw a girl that I was best friends with when we were very young, like kindergarten through second grade!  I couldn't believe we even recognized each other!  it was so crazy!  it was great to see her. then last night, I saw a boy that I went to junior high with, he actually lives on the same floor as me!  I moved around a lot when I was younger, so the people I see, most likely don't even know each other!  wow, I just looked up at the timer and it's already been more than fifteen minutes!  that sure went by a lot faster than the first five!  I wanted to go home this weekend, but I'm waiting until next, our town is having the county fair then. I don't want to admit that I miss home because I told everyone that I couldn't wait to leave!  I was tired of the small town gossip and the close minded ideas of all those small town people!  I do love it here in austin and I even have some family here, but I miss my parents!  I think I might even miss my two younger brothers, now that's crazy!  I think I just miss everything!  I miss my kitty and I especially miss my best friend!  he went to texas tech and I keep telling myself that I'll never see him again, but I pray that I will!          \nAsnwer:"
