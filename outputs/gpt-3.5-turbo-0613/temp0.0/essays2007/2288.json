I am an extremely objective person and it's hard for me focus on something when there is no clear goal in sight, but maybe this will get easier as I go. I hear TV in the next room. My mom is in the kitchen and watching the Republican National Convention. I really should be watching it you because you see I'm a government major (at least that's the plan right now). However, and ironically, the very thing that is going to earn me my government major is also what is keeping me from watching the convention. There now talking about PROPNAME not being a good leader but the AC which is located next to my room has just come on and now I can't hear. Wow, this is getting a little weird having to make myself consciously voice in writing what I'm thinking. It's amazing you can be so unaware of the thoughts that your own brain  is thinking. Ah, pancakes are ready. I would like to go eat them now but I'm stuck here for another 0 minutes and 00 seconds. OOppss, she used baking soda instead of baking powder. No pancakes I guess. I went to the Phantom of the Opera last semester. It was a LOCNAME production and vg. I have a pamphlet from the evening sitting on my desk, which is why I bring it up. I was depressing though, for all  the talent and wonderful set changes. Do you like  the sound of the AC. I  do. I don't know why but it comforts me. I think the reason it does is because when I was younger the AC would come and there was a vent right over my bed  so to keep warm I would have to snuggle deeper into my covers and I like to snuggle. That was a run on sentence but that's how I think, in run ons, so I'm just trying to be accurate. I had to look up how to spell sentence. Yes, I know that's horrible, but you see I'm a very phonetically spell, always have been, and so it's very  hard for  me to distinguish between the phonetically pronunciations of vowels. Like in the word sentence, I'm always unsure if it's sentence or sentence. Another example is that I used to spell \"they\" \"they\" because the e sounded like a long a to me. I better fix that if I'm going into government.  \nAsnwer:"
