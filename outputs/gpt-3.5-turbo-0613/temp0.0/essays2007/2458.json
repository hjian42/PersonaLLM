No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: well since I have this assignment in front of me it is obviously the first thing I am thinking about. I wonder if the fact that I have been thinking about doing this assignment will affect what I write down. it probably will. like, I knew this would happen. I was thinking as soon as we got the assignment that sex is always on my mind and since this is college, I think it will be ok to mention it. my back itches. I got a sunburn yesterday at the beach. I knew I probably should have put sunscreen on, but I am a procrastinator, so I never got around to it. I kept asking my girlfriend if my back was burning yet, and she kept saying \"no\", but I guess she couldn't really tell how bad it was. my roommate just asked me what we had to read for this class. I haven't really been keeping up with my reading lately. I skipped class today also just because I didn't feel like waking up on time. my girlfriend probably is not as smart as me, but most of the time she seems like she works harder than me. when we first started going out she never used to get mad at me for anything. now she is always getting mad at me for everything. she used to laugh when ever I would get lost driving around because I have a bad sense of directions, but now she just always yells at me and says \"where the fuck are you going\". I never get mad at her for things she does to me though. I have infinite almost patience with her. she lost a piece to a puzzle I have had since I was like 0 and all I did was tell her not to worry about it but when ever I do something small like step on her sandal at the mall she gets really pissed off and says \"fuck PROPNAME, watch where the fuck your going, that fucking the second time you've done that shit\". I wish she was not always like that but I still love her very much. we've been together for nearly a year now so I am pretty sure we can last if we want to. I have economics to do. \nAsnwer:"
