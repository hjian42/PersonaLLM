No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well I'm finally getting around doing the writing assignment, I'm feeling  relieved. I thought that for some reason I would not have the time to do  it, actually not get around to doing this assignment. I don't know the  reason behind that worry. hmmm. what do I write?  well I'm getting  tired already and I'm thinking will I be able to stay awake for thirty  minutes to type all this??? I hope so. well I'm thinking about my classes  and panic is setting in. I'm worried. I'm falling behind with reading  material in my courses and not . my mind has moved to something else. THE ORGNAME. I realized that I had to take it this spring so I\u2019m getting  really nervous about it. I'm getting nervous now thinking about it. well  my eyes feel really tired. I want to sleep. I still feel nervous and anxiety towards this semester/the mcat/medical  schools/exams. I usually don't feel this nervous but since this year  counts so much with medical schools I feel that top performance is . what's a good word?  ummm. My mind is drawing a blank. essential?   well good enough. I feel I must perform beyond my own goals. hmm. well I don't really agree with that statement. I just feel I need to  do good. I need to be satisfied. Hopefully get a 0. 0 this semester. what else?  I'm thinking what else I should write about? It's quiet in here. the fan is turned on. BUT its a LOCNAME. or bay  something. let me  see if I remember?? NOPE I sure don't. Well I didn't exercise today,  which explain why I'm soo tired. I love running it gives me so much energy and makes me feel great. I love working out, but nowadays I don\u2019t have much  time b/c I live off campus and commuting and parking takes too much time  that I just run at home sometimes, if I find a running buddy. the  nervousness is gone, but it left a massive headache. massive, I like that  word its sounds so cute  when English people say it with their English accents. I'm worried. again. actually I'm thinking about my teacher recommendations  which is getting me worried. so I'm worrying myself now. too much of this  is not too good. I knew a girl who used to give herself ulcers,, I'm  wondering if it was psychological?  well,, probably there was some  psychological reason. woow,, I'm so happy I'm taking this course. its soo cool. I'm really tired. and bored now. yet I feel indifferent. as I was saying I think psychology is soo interesting. it seems really cool. The lectures are awesome. I'm happy. until the  first round of tests. curiosity and anxiety well not really I'm kind of curious . I'm thinking about my friend. old roomie. she\u2019s in the corps at a&m and I'm  worried about her. I wish she would quit because they are so ridiculous. their little rules are ridiculous. when people have to pee in their sinks  because its easier to do than go to the bathroom that's when you have to  worry. I'm still worried. she's a good person. but that the path she  chose for herself. I\u2019m hoping this will make me feel better. its working  I feel better now. but I'm still worried not so much upset,,, I wonder  how long I've been typ0ing?  I hope long enough let me take a peek at my  watch. YUP!!! yes! its been 00 minutes I'm not sure if I did this right. I sure hope so. I'm getting sleep and I still have a ton of work to do. I think I'll sleep my brain needs to replenish the exhausted brain cells. well I guess I'll end this now and go to bed. One thing I noticed is that  I was kinda indifferent not too emotional all through this because of my  fatigue. well . good night. and sweet dreams. and as my old roommate  would say. \" don't let the bed bugs bite\". I hope she pulls through. \nAsnwer:"
