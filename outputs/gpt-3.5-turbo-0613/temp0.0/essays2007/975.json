I know this happens all the time, but still it hurt. and I don't know why. I mean its not like I need love and attention all that much. okay, so maybe I do. but is that so bad. but it seems that everytime I find someone who does love me I find a way to push them away. I don't know. maybe I'm not meant to be happy. I really do hate being so dependant. and I don't know why I am. maybe its genetic. maybe not. maybe I'm just becoming one of those messed up people I never wanted to become. who knows. usually when I write stream of consiousness it turns very melodic and down trodden. I guess this keyboard messing up might be helping things. I don't know. I'm not really tired, but I have so much to do. and I do want to get some sleep. maybe getting dumped on some is good for me, maybe it will wake me up. maybe I am dreaming too much. maybe none of this is real, and I'm jus+t fooling myself. who knows, I surely don't. but its kinda bad being so dependant, especially when you don't attract girls by the dozen. but I can not help it, its who I am. a hopeless romantic, lost in a non romantic world. oh, for the days of the cowboys. when men were men. or medevil times, with knights, and damsels. and fuedal kingdoms. and the plauge. ring around the rosey. ugh. I hated that game as a child. but now I think its kinda fun. I dunno, I jus+t want someone to share with, to be with. maybe thats too much to ask out of every girl's best friend. sigh. I really don't want to go to work tommorrow. I mean I do okay, at it. but I'm just not annoying enough to be really good at it. plus I guess there's no incentive. I don't know if I want to go back to dallas on the first. I'm not sure if I want to go back period. don't get me wrong. I mean I miss some of the people. but I want to get past Mesquite. to move on with my life. I guess I have a lot of trouble moving on. but somtimes people jus+t make it too hard. this is a very pretty song. I may ask PROPNAME out. as a matter of fact, I think I will. but is it wrong??  I don't know. I'm not s+ure if I'm qualified to say. I'm not sure who is. I've done so many things that I said id never do. oh man. am I messed up??  isn't that somthing we are always asking ourselves though???  or at least it seems I am. I mean I have never loved anyone the w0ay I loved PROPNAME, since PROPNAME, if that makes any sense. I'm just so utterly confused at the moment. I don't know. plus I have too much to do to be w0orrying about all this. life should be so easy right now. I should be having a ball. but I'm not. and I hate it. \nAsnwer:"
