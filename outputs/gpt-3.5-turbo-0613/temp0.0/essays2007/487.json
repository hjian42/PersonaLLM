All these people think they're such hot shit because they're pretty now or whatever. And it's pathetic how they're still emotionally screwed up because PROPNAME PROPNAME made fun of them in the third grade and they still haven't recovered. Give me a break. It's been 00 years - get over it!!!! And I hate when the audience says -\"You must have gotten the wrong PROPNAME, You don't need PROPNAME PROPNAME - You need PROPNAME PROPNAME!\" Ha Ha Ha. I feel really bad for lying to PROPNAME last night. I love him so much and I don't know why I always cut corners. Where's the harm in saying yeah PROPNAME 0 pike idiots were here last night and I drank a couple beers. He won't care. It's like I lie more when I'm completely innocent than I do when I'm totally guilty. Not that I'm guilty ever but anyway. It was so stupid that he got mad about PROPNAME being over last night. Oh that guy is hot on tv. Anyway, It's not like I'm all buddy-buddy with her now. We were just reminiscing. Though we had a lot of shitty times together and I essentially hate her psycho guts, we did have a lot of good times together. Halloween was so much fun. I hope this year is just as fun. I hope Matt doesn't come down and be a bum. I hope if he's here in LOCNAME he'll dress up and be stupid with us. I also hope he starts liking my friends more. I love him, but he's got to accept all of me. Damn, nice house. This guy has a really cool pool with a bridge over it. Neat. But - --I forget what I was talking about. He's been so sweet since I left. I never heard him be so goofy over me and writing me letters and saying how much he loves me all of the time. I don't know if it's just because he's so lonely in SFA but I like ie. He makes me feel good when he's all mushy and stuff. I really need to turn off the tv. Everything I think gets clouded up by what's on tv. Oh well because my time is up. \nAsnwer:"
