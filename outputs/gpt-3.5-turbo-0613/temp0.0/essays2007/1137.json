No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: As I write my first writing assignment, I can't help but notice the time: 0:00pm. As usual, my radio is on. It only takes away the silence in my apartment. Blank. My head is blank. Empty. With nothing to say or write about. This has never been a problem before. In high school, there was never silence. Maybe I was always too busy to hear the silence. Now, it's a part of my life. At certain times last year, I could hear it. Weird, seeing how it was my freshman year in college. This year is my second year and I seem to hear nothing but silence. I am still involved in the same activities as last year. Perhaps, it's a sign that I'm finally growing up. Another weird concept. I am thinking that I like silence. Deep down, I do believe that I am a loner. In high school, who would have thought? A loner should be lonely, right? But I am not lonely nor am I ever bored. I like to do things by myself. I think that's it. I don't need anyone. I don't need companionship nor do I need to be felt needed. Awww. to much of the word, \"need\". No more. I am happy. I am content. I am selfassured. I told my mom once that I was a loner, but I can't remember what she said. I don't think she even responded to me. Funny thing though. I know I want to be married someday. Now, how would a loner accomplish something like that? I socialize very little these days. My mind is always on school and my studies. I just want that medical acceptance letter in my hands. That is all that counts. Well, not all. My family counts too. They mean more to me than anything. My little brother is here at LOCNAME. (he's no longer little anymore) I'm hoping he enjoys his first year. I know I did. So many memories to reminisce. Time: 0:00pm. My goal this semester is: 0. 0 ORGNAME. I really need to bring up my ORGNAME from first year. And my goal next semester is: 0. 0 GPA. My uncle always says, hard work will always be paid off in the end. Consistency + Confidence = Success. 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0. I hope I can do it. I hope I can do it. I hope I can do it. I know I can do it. I hope I won't be behind in my classes. Especially in that chem. Class. It seems like a really hard class. I can feel those late nighters already. Time: 0:00pm. \nAsnwer:"
