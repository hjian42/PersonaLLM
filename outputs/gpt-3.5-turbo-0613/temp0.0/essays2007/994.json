No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Mostly I'm reeling in amazement at how complicated looking a Vitamin B-00 molecule is. That goofy larry wall and his themed state of the onion adresses. heh. Doh. keep writing. I suppose turning off the TV and ignoring IRC for a while would be a good idea. Twenty minutes eh. that's a long time. I suppose I ought to mark the start time. 00:00 will do nicely. Dootdedoo. Wellk look at that, jam's brain goes blank, remembers the TV, backtracks to PROPNAME's debut in World Championship Wrestling and thinks how pathetic it was. PROPNAME PROPNAME is such an idiot. Oooh. I'll fight buff bagwell. moron. PROPNAME is a face. HE'll kick your (bleep) into the next country. (The vodoscriber upon which this was composed, the browser into which it was copied, the web server which processed the request, and the routers involved in the communication are all members of the machine purity league wihch has as one of it's bylaws: \"No machine shall reproduce obscenities or lewdness in any way other than (bleep), even if pounded upon. This is to protect biotics from themselvels. \"  All hail PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. )  I suppose it was inevitable that I'd think of school. My use of (bleep) led to that rather long parenthetical outbusrt, which in turn made me think of his mighty authorliness Mr. PROPNAME, which in turn caused me to spontaneously recall several large words and what I did for an hour or three today. I do find it slightly amusing that in 0 out of my 0 classes today, a laptop and a puter-screen projector appeared. It's such a pity they all had crappy operating systems on them. Although the ORGNAME one was the worst. Windows. How sickening. I can't stand that feited piece of monkey (bleep). How the unholy hell can anyone consider paying for something so unbelieveably substandard?  If you buy a car and it spontaneously explodes in the middle of the road, you go get your bloody money back. If Windows explodes in a massive BSOD fireball, you just dutifully push reset. And NO, I am NOT a moc user. In fact, I find macos insulting. uh oh. flexy lexy, lex luger is coming back with his hulk PROPNAME is a jackass proof. I bet its true. hogan has done this sort of thing before. he is a heel. he has to pay marvel (I think) for using the old red and yellow, so chances are it won't last. You know, I hope I'm doing this properly. No I don't. I don't care. It's simply do-and-get-credit. PROPNAME. lex has a picture apparently. Oooh. no pleasure in what you do. pity you sound like an idiot. The stinger coming out. joy. I like his entrance music. It's nifty. Sorta ominus and stuff. I liked sting better when he wore a trenchcoat, carried a baseball bat and descended from the ceiling. Pity those columbine dicks had to go and ruin the trenchcoat thing, and then the late, great, owen hart's descent into a ring post stopped the rafters stuff. I keep forgetting sting gets a title shot later this month. Damnit lex, get to the bloody point. I don't want to hear this crap. Irrefutable proof. Pfft. Scam artist. that's a good one. Did you think that up yourself?GET TO THE POINT YOU NADEATER. Jesus. you are so annoyng. PROPNAME rammed PROPNAME with the hummer. what the hell. oh that's so conclusive. Of course hogan drive's a hummer. That's such bs. you queer bastard. You better pheer hogan's wrath. Doh. keep writing. Uhh. write write rite. Er. type type type. I'm not sure what the hell to type. Let's pop the fingers and otherwise kill some time waiting for something to come to mind. take a drink, piss o. er. no. Why did DDP just suckerpunch hogan. that's so queer. Damnit I hate it when they do that. What the hell just happened?  Is hogan evil?  Is lex joining DDP?  Is sting believing this (bleep)?  Will gris ruin heller?  Heh. I bet that last one stumped you. Well, it would if you a) were reading this and b) had the same schema as me. Gris is the main character from. hmm. am I supposed to be doing this like this?  Let's read the question again. Oh now that'd piss me off. netscape I swear to all deities, gods, elements, and prophets that ever were, are or ever will be, fact or fiction, that if you crash after me typing all of this, I will personally rip you byte from byte and eat your mother's soul. Do you understand?  TNhat's good. E>RRRRRRRRRRR. the best show on television. Not quite, but a damn fine show none-the-less. nonetheless has no hy---(BLEEPING) BIBLE COMMERCIAPROPNAME there is no bloody god, and if there is I still wouldn't care. If he's going to drop me into the fire just because I don't give a shit about him then he isn't the loving bloody god that ppl say he is and he should be shot, hung, burned, kicked in the nuts and then REALLY hurt. Oooh. scantily clad females. there goes my id again. I bet I could get ted to help me with my psych homework. maybe he knows some good stuff to do that research paper on, because there is no way in LOCNAME that I'm going to do that bloody experimentation stuff. Not only can I not stand people, I can't stand speaking to them, or doing the stuff they tell me, so the entire theory of experimenting on me is . well it just doesn't work. I find the whole idea so repulsive that I'd wrather wriiteaotnseuhsatnoheusnaoheu. rather write a 0 page is it? research paper than do that. What a lazy (bleepard) I am. Oh look. time's getting close to up. if it didn't require my stopping I'd go make one of these clocks show me the seconds. pity, that. Wait wait wait. wait wait wait. heh. At the third tone the time will me 000000. beep beep BEEP. L. PROPNAME PROPNAME probably owns the copyright on Gris and all the other mission earth stuff, even if he is dead. And his worship himself DNA, PROPNAME PROPNAME definately, unless he's a complete moron, owns the trademark/copyright on the number 00. \nAsnwer:"
