I am Catholic, I   like to play the piano, I miss my family, I miss my friends. I do have   alot of friends that came to ORGNAME with me, but I didn't really hang out with   them much in high school because I had a boyfriend and seemed to live a   totally different life than they did. They were on the debate team, I was   on the dance team, I joined every organization there was in high school   because it gave me an explanation as to why my grades were not so great.  All my friends here are really smart, they all graduated in the top ten   percent of the class. My cell phone is ringing now. I really want to pick   it up, but I think it's just my cousin so I'll leave it alone. It kind of   gets on my nerves that she calls my cell phone all the time, instead of my   room number when I told her that when she calls it costs me alot, it's   long distance. I still have the same number from back home, so my mom can   call for free. I had a bad dream the other night about my mom. I dreamt   that she had done something really sweet for me,  and I didn't appreciate   it. All I could think about was being with my friends. When I came to   orientation this summer, I hated it! I called my mom every 00 minutes   telling her that I would rather go to ORGNAME ORGNAME or ORGNAME ORGNAME, the   community college in my hometown. But now that I'm here, I really like it.  I don't miss her as much as I thought I would. I really miss my   exboyfriend. I think I disliked orientation so much because we had just   broken up. We had gone out all through high school, and he's at ORGNAME now.  That's where I really wanted to go. I got in, and into the business school   too, but I really wanted to be in the honors program. I guess I was a   little conceited and believed that I was smarter than the average student   at ORGNAME. Anyway, I had applied really early and hadn't heard from them, I   waited and waited. I received my letter from UT but it didn't mean   anything to me, because I didn't know anything about this college, none of   my friends were going here, and Kit wouldn't be here. But my parents gave   me a deadline and said I had to decide on a college by March 00 or   something. So, I decided to come here. I think mostly because I was upset   that Tech wasnt' as eager to accept me into the honors college, and I also   thought, tons of couples go to different colleges, and if they can make   it, surely Kit and I can. Well, prom rolled around about 0 to 0 weeks   later, and Kit made prom court. We were both amazed. Because he made   court, he had to learn how to dance and eat properly, and wear a coat and   tails tux, which really didn't look that great on him since he was a bulky   football player. So the day of prom rolls around, and Kit callls about 0   to say that the court got a limo. I thought   Great, now we don't have to   worry about transportation!   But then he said there wouldn't be enough   room for the dates, just the court. So I asked him, am I suppossed to go   to prom alone? And he told me to have my parents drive me! I was so upset   becuase later on I found out the court had a choice to ride the limo or   not, and Kit choose to ride with people he hardly knew than to take me. I   don't know if I'll ever be able to forget how awful he made me feel.  Everytime I think of my prom, I'll always remember that. He also said   during prom , that I had been acting weird ever since I choose UT. That   made me even more upset, because he had never brought it up before, he had   always said, do what's best for you. I didn't know that he thought what   was best for me was him, and not a better education. I miss him so much. I   tried to get back with him this summer,and he said he wanted to too, but   everytime we'd almost get back together, he'd say no. That it would be too   hard to have a long distance relationship. I'm really disappointed in him,   this summer he went and got a tatoo, knowing that I dispise them, and   right before he left for Tech he didn't tell me about it. A week later, I   ran into his parents at Best Buy and his mother told me. Each time he does   something like this I vow this is the last time, I'm through with him, but   I keep going back, thinking about how good it used to be, and I fall in   love with his memory all over again. I wonder if he's dating anyone yet. I   d \nAsnwer:"
