No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      My thoughts and feelings-- most of what graces my thoughts and feelings these days are boys. Yes, i'm still in high school, I might add. I have been screwed by boys. All of them in fact. Please just let me tell you about the not calling about the not buying me flowers and the not recognising me for the princess that I am. I guess you could call me high maintenance. And yes you would be correct in assuming so. But I definately deserve to be treated like a princess. End of story. Nothing else to it-- treat me like I'm a princess and I'm as good as yours. . well not really but it goes something like that. My mom taught me how to be a princess, yes, I was taught by the queen herself, PROPNAME PROPNAME. My PROPNAME PROPNAME is sick right now. with pneumonia (don't ask me how to spell it because I don't know and I guess I don't care because you don't see me looking for a dictionary, now do you?)  But anywho, she's really sick and also just happens to be moving to LOCNAME in two days-- go figure. So she's sick as a dog and I get to pack for her, bring her water, bring her wet washcloths, bring her advil, bring her anything her little heart desires-- as for me?  I'm not the princess when I'm at home-- maybe PROPNAME, but as for now, my sick mom is occupying all my time, well at least a little of it, but who doesn't like to be taken care of?  Thus the practice of princessism!  Where's the 'king' you might ask-- well he's in LOCNAME, (which of course would be the new kingdom. ) making the money so that my mom and I can spend it all on things that we want and really don't need-- he's a really sweet guy. They all say that you 'marry your father' and I would love to get a guy that's as sweet as he is, but I just really don't think that one exists. So this little princess metaphor is really working for me!  I just cannot wait to get married. I think about that a lot too!  Well, not actually being married, but GETTING married-- my wedding!  Every time I go to a wedding or see a wedding dress or blah blah blah. it just gets me all excited!  I can't wait to dress up all pretty and have everyone look at me and say how beautiful I am. ahhh, it's great to think about!  Well I guess that those are probably the only two things that I ever think about-- well except for classes sometimes, oh and being grossly skinny, that would be fun for about a day. I would hate to be skinny forever, that would be terrible, but you want to hear terrible?  Every guy that I've ever dated has been skinnier than me. Now I'm not fat, I'm just not skinny and the guys that I date ARE!  Also, every guy I've dated has also cheated on me, isn't that great for my self esteem?  I really think so, because now every guy I see I'm thinking 'hyyyyaaaaah!  I want to beat the snot out of you!!  I want to karate chop your face until your eyes bleed!! ahhh!!'  . And that's every guy I see, so I'm thinking that a whole bunch too. I guess I think of 0 different things now. Because before it was only two, but then I remembered how much I hated guys and I got to thinking 'well I guess I think about that a lot too'  Maybe I'm not so boring after all. . Just kidding, I really feel like I sound terribly superficial-- I think about other things, but my brain has been so full of bullshit lately that there's not room for much else that won't just be covered in the bullshit of my mind as well. case in point. I guess that's my excuse for not thinking, even though it's really hard for me not to be thinking about something all the time-- that's what's wrong with culture today-- we're always so busy doing something and once there's nothing to do, we're 'bored'  but why is that?  How can we be bored when we always complain about being too busy. wouldn't you think that we'd welcome this so- called 'boredom'??  I think we should. I was bored about 00 minutes ago so I decided to do my writing assignment, and here I am!!  I guess it feels good to vent things, but I probably wouldn't do it unless it was an assignment-- it's good to see my mind on paper even though it's not really paper, it's a screen, but same difference, work with me here, stop being so complicated. Please let me tell you how much I love to sing. . and at the same time I'll tell you that I'm no good because I am, but still, how cool would it be to be the lead singer of a band?  My current official 'non- boyfriend' right now (I broke up with him 0 days ago) is in a band and they're looking for a singer, but I know that he would never want me to sing because he's heard me sing, and well I guess I won't sing in THAT band, but oh well, well that's all I have to say about that. \nAsnwer:"
