    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I don't know what I am going to do in this. This type of assignment is something I have not done before. I guess I have no idea is because that I do not have a topic to write on. I have always have had a topic assigned to me. This is el-hazard music. Just by looking at the images of the CD cover, I can tell that this is going to be good. In fact, I am listening to it right now. I have no idea why I am writing this down in here, but it is a part of my thought. This has a lot of base, but it does not stick out. Has a very good balance of treble and base. What am I going to write about. I am hungry. May be I can go to kinsolving later. I think that they start dinner at four thirty. Another track has started. This is a slow song now. It is the music from the fourth episode where the demon goddess is freed from her master's control and gained her freedom for the first time. The cat  Ura was cool. She can mountain climb. I think that was a cliff. She is the coolest cat ever. I have to do this for 00 minutes. What oh yes the ura. The series is El-hazard. They don't have anything good on the internet on it. this sucks. I have to download that song tonight. I hope this time the connection is good enough. Why is some of the music stupid. Wait, if I listen to this closely, it is very good if the voice of the actress is older. The story has good development. The ova series starts with the discovery of the demon goddess ORGNAME in a certain high school and the main guy is sent to the world El-hazard through a portal created by PROPNAME. Why is the TV series different from the OAV series. The princess PROPNAME PROPNAME looks cute, I like her better in the OVA series. I think a world like el-hazard lives in our hearts. PROPNAME PROPNAME was rescued by the teacher. That was cool. PROPNAME kick. There were this little girl in the story. She was PROPNAME. The 0 priestess was pretty. fire, wind and water. Reminds me of Ah megamisama. 00 minutes. Ifurita was awakened by junnai. Then he and Ifurita invaded  PROPNAME the kingdom of El-hazard. They had to use the eye of god for defense. The TV series was called the wanderers. that was cool. The main guy can access ancient relics. He gave back ifurita her freedom by turning off the master obey chip. The war was still going on the LOCNAME used the eye of god. Kimdom of bugrom got kicked. The shadow nation intervened. The moved the eye of god out of control for the revenge a long time ago. They were remnant of the tribe that come across this world when the eye was first fired. They were hated afterwards. PROPNAME. I am hooked on this series too much. The main guy got control of the eye through Ifurita but Ifurita sustained the impact and was transported to the location where the high school will be in 00000 years. Ifurita then waited 00000 years for makoto to appear and send makoto to the land of el-hazard. After the impact, Ifurita learned the secret of eye of god. It is a dimensional cannon. what was cool. is it 00 minutes yet. Still 0 minutes. Have I been keeping time correctly. KOR orange road. I am still listening to the same music. cool. I can't wait to see the TV series tape # 0. It is going to be very good. I don't know I guess I am too excited about this thing to stop, I have not even realized I stayed on the same topic for long. men. \nAsnwer:"
