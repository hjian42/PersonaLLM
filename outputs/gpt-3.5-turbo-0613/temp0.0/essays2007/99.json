My housing  is not air conditioned. I'm not used to doing homework like this so you'll have to bear with me. I tried to do this assignment about a week ago. after some fifteen minutes I was kicked off. I was beyond pissed. My  ankle is itching. Yesterday we went to mar's and we waited outside and I sat in the grass. For some reason that makes my leg itch. I wind is  blowing in my room and it feels good. I am very tired and want to go back to sleep. I took an hour nap awhile ago. PROPNAME came down. I hear people talking in the alley. One of them is a guy. I wish PROPNAME could stay here with me in LOCNAME. I miss him so much. I'm so pathetic. The tissue on  my computer is waving like a flag, so are the papers on my bulletin board. I need to call my tutors one day. I need one in math more than anything  else. I'm not stupid or anything, I just need assistance on the problems sometimes. PROPNAME say's that I don't have a life. That I has no personality. That made my confidence soar. I know I didn't have a life, but I really couldn't help it. My parents are super, super strict and I wasn't allowed to do normal teenager stuff. Even now that I can I\u2019m restricted to because of my boyfriend PROPNAME. He cam down tonight. I love him so much. He should be calling in about an hour to say that he got home safe and sound. He's mad at PROPNAME because PROPNAME wouldn't leave us alone today. I was kind of mad too. PROPNAME doesn't like the thought of me and PROPNAME spending time  together. He's weird like that. PROPNAME should be nicer to his parents. They both have the mind set on he acts like a butt so I will too. PROPNAME is very stubborn but his parents are not very nice. At least I had a close family. PROPNAME doesn't even think that his parents love him. I know they do but he  doesn't think that they do. He still sees himself and their mistake. I  don't know what to tell him to believe otherwise. I'm going back home on  October 0th. PROPNAME's birthday is on that weekend. Saturday will be a lot  of fun. After that I\u2019ll be going to the renaissance festival  with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. We're going to camp down there. It'll be a lot of fun. PROPNAME  can be a lot of fun if he's not in his pouty mood. Maybe he'll find  himself a girlfriend by then. Then he'll be happy. I think. He didn't  seem to mind our relationship when he was dating. he was too into PROPNAME. I didn't like her and knew she was going to hurt him but as usual no one  listened to me. I like my room it's nice. I live at the women's co-ops. They are cool. All the girls in the house have made me feel completely  welcome. I've been typing for about ten minutes. I think that's pretty  good. If y\u2019all read this y\u2019all will have a lot to read. I'm trying to  type slow so this won't get too long. I'm typing about half of my normal typing speed. Doug liked PROPNAME. He'd like to have her legs wrapped  around him. He is very crass. Then again PROPNAME can be that way too. He is rarely rude to me though. I'm am usually respected and taken care of by my guys. I'm used to being protected. It's weird being down here knowing that I can actually be hurt. That is scary. My guys live two and a half hours away. We won the football game today. The tower is lit up. I love ORGNAME. I love the freedom I acquired when I came down here. It's not that  I\u2019m partying and getting drunk and toasted all the time. I just like that fact that I can if I want too. I don't have to beg to be let out of the house or anything. I've even been studying more down here than I did at home. I've kept up with all of my classes so far. I'll be doing some  of my homework tomorrow. I read the assigned readings in between classes. The written assignments that actually take time get done at home. I have a quiz in math Monday. My foot hurts. It's been reclining against the  chair too long. My hand hurts too. It\u2019s resting on the edge of my desk. I am getting all sticky and sweaty doing this paper. My legs are sweaty  against the seat. The back of my neck and my arms are also sweaty. PROPNAME left his bobo feit action figure with me. He's the  bounty hunter from  star wars. I'm very surprised because he's very important to PROPNAME. I am  honored that he did. It's on my desk right next to my pewter angel/moon and stars figurine. I got that with PROPNAME in LOCNAME. We went to ORGNAME with the school marching band during spring break. The figurine cost me seventy bucks. It was definitely worth it. I've been typing for  a little over twenty minutes. Bye. \nAsnwer:"
