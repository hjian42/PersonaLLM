I've been to two of my three classes today. I was starting to fall asleep in my stats class. It's my most boring class of the day. I still have to go to my Rhetoric class. It's pretty boring too. I'm not a very good writer at all. I don't much enjoy going to class. I don't apply myself to school near as much as I should. I say I'm going to study but then I put it off until the last second. I guess there are a lot of people that do too. I'm pretty bad though. I don't study hardly at all and make B's and C's. I don't fell stupid for making sub par grades but I do feel stupid for not studying and trying. Then I could get all A's and B's. I'm a pretty laid back guy. Things don't bother me very easily. but when they do, I can't get them off my mind until their resolved. I live with three other guys. They can be idiots sometimes, but for the most part they're pretty cool. I have a girlfriend that I've been with for a year and a half. We don't fight very much. She gets mad at me a lot more than I get mad at her. She never use to get mad at me. But then a few weeks before I moved down to LOCNAME she started. I think it's because she had stay home and finish school and I got to come down to LOCNAME and experience new things. I feel that I don't love her as much as I use to. My twenty minutes is up so I'm going to go to English. This wasn't as bad as I had thought it would be. \nAsnwer:"
