No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I really need to study for chemistry, but I just remembered that this assignment was due. I  would have done it earlier, but my computer has been giving me so many problems. First  all these warnings about \"you have spyware and adware\" started coming up and then it started  working really slow--it took 00 minutes to open up the internet!!  Then after a while it wouldn't  even do that--it just sat there!  So I tried to shut it down and it still didn't do anything--but if I  tried to start a program, it said \"This program cannot open because the system is shutting  down. \"  So I unplugged it and let the battery run out. Computers are so stupid. But I guess we  couldn't live without them. I really hope I don't fail this chemistry test tomorrow. I'm really  nervous because it's my first real college test and it's also over some stuff that I don't  completely understand. My roommate is in the same class as me, but she's at the ORGNAME--she  calls it her home because she's there every minute of every day--I don't know how she does it!!  Studying for 00 minutes makes me feel like I need a break--she stays there for hours!!  She's  really sweet though. I so happy I got good roommates (yes--that's plural--I have 0  roommates--I'm in supplemental housing--it's not as bad as I thought it would be)  0 of my  roommates are really nice. The other one is kind of weird, but she's hardly ever here--she's  always at her boyfriend's house. That's kind of rude to her parents though--I mean--they're  paying for her food and housing and she's not even sleeping here. The only thing I know about  her is her name really. That's okay though--at least she's not using my computer all the time  anymore. When we first moved in she didn't have a Ethernet cord so I said she could do her  add/drops on my pc. But then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes (on MY  printer--with MY ink) so at least that's not happening any more. PROPNAME PROPNAME lost in the quarterfinals of the US Open tonight. That made me so sad--I LOVE  PROPNAME PROPNAME--he has to be the sexiest guy ever!  I met him last year and the Tennis Masters  Series in LOCNAME and he signed my shirt--me and 0 of my friends had made shirts that spelled  out PROPNAME--he and his coach really liked them!!  But I really wanted him to win--he won the  Open last year and that was his first so I really wanted him to defend it. Oh well. The guy he  lost to was playing really good. He played the same type of game as PROPNAME though. They were  calling him a Swedish PROPNAME PROPNAME, but he'll never be PROPNAME PROPNAME--he wasn't cute enough. Chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester. I'm not really sure if I want to  major in biology any more. I think it might just be too much science for me. I thought I could  handle it, but I just don't know anymore. I know majoring in biology will probably help me  make a good score on the ORGNAME, though. I really want to get into med school. I want to be a  pediatrician. It's just so much school though. OY!  But I think it'll pay off. I really want to do  something with kids and I could do that and make money at the same time. I mean--it's that or  teaching right?  and teaching is definitely NOT on my list of things I want to do. My mom is a  teacher and they don't get paid half of what they deserve!  She works all the time--sometimes  she doesn't come home until after midnight--and she only works with 0th and 0th graders. I  mean--it's probably worse with older kids right?  I don't know--I just couldn't handle it--I'd  feel like I deserved more. Chemistry time. \nAsnwer:"
