Simple Plan is a cool band. I wonder what my friends are doing later for supper. I don't feel like going to class at 0. I just want to sleep. I wish my boyfriend and I would stop getting into arguments. It really sucks when we fight, I hate it!  I'm kind of hungry. Where is my roommate?  It seems like she is never here. Oh well, more private time for me. I miss my mom. I have so much to read for my classes. Chapters and chapters and chapters!  Looks like I have my work cut out for me for a long time. My Spanish class seems really easy, I hope it gets harder, so I feel more challenged. I wonder when I should go talk to an advisor about my major. Should I change it, not change it, minor, or double major. why is everything so difficult?  All questions and decisions in life should be yes/no or multiple choice!  That would be so wonderful. Celebrities are so gorgeous, they suck. Although, they are pretty cool people. I guess, I don't really know them. I have an itch on my leg. I hope I don't get sick, that would be horrible. I can't wait for the game on Saturday. It's going to be so much fun. Rap music gets on my nerves. I need to finish taking pictures on my camera so I can get them film developed. Why is so cold in here. I turn the air warmer, and it gets too hot, then I turn it cooler, and it gets too cold!  That sound is annoying, I wonder if the AC is supposed to make that noise. This room needs to be vacuumed. It's gross. My mom sent me a letter. Yay!  I'm excited, but I can't open it until I'm done writing this assignment!  I need to turn my closet light off. I'm thirsty. I feel like drinking a Dr. Pepper. That sounds so yummy!  I think I might eat a pickle when I'm done too. That sounds like a plan. I'm almost done with this thing. Mom uses ugly stamps. Oh well, I have cute ones. \nAsnwer:"
