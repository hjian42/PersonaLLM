This morning at church I felt more comfortable becuase it was more traditional to me. I guess after my youth back at my hometown that's all I like. My stomach hurts a little right now, as much as I eat I don't know why I keep losing weight. Last night was our date with PROPNAME and ORGNAME, it didn't go as planned, at least for me. I don't know what the deal is, but my luck with women is just not the best. Man, those little granola bars are the best, the one I ate with my salad today. I'm thinking about talking to that girl in the cafeteria. She is 00 I think, but then again, age is only a number in college. In college it doesn't feel like I'm classified anymore, it's just that I'm an adult now. Since I've been here, I miss my family, but I haven't gotten homesick. Traffic here is horrible, it's to fast. I want to see that new movie PROPNAME v. s. PROPNAME. I don't know why but I read that this girl wasn't into scary movies. It's dark outside, I think I'm going to go run after this. Well the Titans v. s. Raiders game is on. I went to PROPNAME's house yesterday to go watch all the football games that went on for college. Hopefully I don't get challenged for beating PROPNAME and PROPNAME at ORGNAME. That referee has an anoying voice. I ate a cookies and cream Ice Cream bar, it was pretty good. My roommate is laying down. I don't know why it seems he doesn't have as much school work as I do. I type pretty fast for a guy. I really need to get that program for my computer with Power point and all. Right now I'm looking at a picture of my family and pet's. I think I have to have the best parent's ever, I mean, if it weren't for them I wouldn't be here right now. I kind of want to here some PROPNAME PROPNAME. This guy said he french kiss a french woman. Kinda funny. This weekend we went to PROPNAME's, met up with PROPNAME, couldn't get a wristband. My printer is so slow, it's loud also. My fingers are kind of cramping and I still have 00 minutes left. There is a little running icon on the left of my screen. The sky looks awesome right now, it's like the sun just passed the horizon. I got back in at 0 a. m. last night. I was pretty tired, I ate a pop tart before I went to bed. I don't know why, but I knew I shouldn't have ate but I was hungry. I always think to myself If you just sleep through it, you won't be hungry\" I talked to PROPNAME today, she is pretty hot. I think she has a boyfriend back in her hometown. Speaking of which, why is everyone going back home? They just got here. I know if I went to Tech I wouldn't be going home all the time. I keep hearing a little bit of words from the TV  and it said \" the crowd is loud \" and \"another flag down \" PROPNAME note says, Aug 00 FIG meeting. Our FIG supervisor is pretty hot also. She is a sophomore, so maybe I could talk to her too. Next week we play arkansas. I remember one time at Tech during my athletic training for ORGNAME, I thought I was in a tornado. PROPNAME was eating pizza that night. A bright neon light. I hope that this test doesn't say that I think about food to much, I've said something about food like 0 times. I used to be a big guy, 000 lbs. Now I'm down to 000. I feel better, just not sculpted. I'm kinda nervous to go to LOCNAME gym to go join a rec sport. I'm not sure how it works and I don't have the money to just throw up in the air. Hey, I just looked away from the computer for once. Right now as I type I'm looking at all the wires on the floor. That could start a fire. Nah, the papers are not close enough. That didn't make sense. I have this candle from initiation the other night. I kept it because I like keeping sentimental. I also collect coca cola bottles. I gave up cokes like a year ago. I think this whole year I might of had 00 cokes all together. That's healthy. Especially here, all you can do is sweat here, I hate it. The trash can is fully, I threw it yesterday but I forgot to put a bag in it. I hear someone passing outside. You know, sometimes I drift away from my mind set when I drive. It's like I don't remember how I was driving from point A to point B. It's kind of hard to explain. It usually happens when I have a millions things running through my head. Internet globe. That recycling commercial keeps coming on that bad ass station. 00. 0. Love. My mom loves me, she wants to send me money for my birthday next week. Wow, the big 00. I'm getting old, only 0 more years and all will be good. Something I've waited for in awhile. My grandparent's. God bless their souls. I miss them so much. Love you Grandma and Grandpa!         \nAsnwer:"
