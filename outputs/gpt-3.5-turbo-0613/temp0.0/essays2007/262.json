No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I just wasted over an hour and a half trying to get my stupid Ethernet card to work. the worst part is that I waited over four weeks for this stupid thing to come in and now none of the drivers and software recognize it. I think it is  royally <blank>. now I have to waste another two hours talking to technical  support so they can take the thing back. what a rip. this makes this day a  really big let down, considering I complained to my parents about getting this  thing up here for me. I could have been doing some of the hundreds of hours of  homework that I have to do. this day has been really wasted. every day is a  waste. all I do is homework each day and nothing more or less. occasionally I get to watch half an hour of television or go to the union or go play a few  video games, but lately, it seems that every class wants me to spend a few hours each night working on their assignments. I haven't even had time to look around the LOCNAME area. I haven't seen a movie in a while either. this place  really sucks. I don't do anything really interesting. I have no life. now I\u2019m complaining too much AND being self-conscious. I couldn't even read my notes on that example. he talks too fast for people to keep up. psychology sounds pretty cool. the breeze never hits ORGNAME. it's like it is always hot and the sun never goes away. maybe one day it will turn into fall in this town and finally it's  be relatively cool so I don't marinate in my own juices. yeah, I know it sounds gross, but what would you call it? I take a shower, walk to PROPNAME, when I  get there, I\u2019m tired and need to take a shower, and I sure do work up an appetite. it's the way back that is a killer. by the time you get back to PROPNAME hill, you feel like rolling over and dying because of your full stomach, the  supersaturated shirt and the fatigued feet. I need to jog more. it seems like  I\u2019ll never have time. I never have time to do any of my old hobbies. for crying out loud, I can't even get y network card to install onto my notebook. I wish I had time to do my old hobbies, like photography. I could have and should have majored in photography. maybe I should major is psychology. it's a really  interesting class and I kind of like it I wish they served more than three flavors of ice-cream. it's like that chicken. 'today for dinner, roasted chicken. for lunch it'll be chicken dumplings, tomorrow it'll be chicken soup. then  creamy chicken blank. tomorrow it is chicken patties, the next day it is chicken nuggets, the next day they'll run out of chicken and serve chicken fried steak with chicken gravy for the steak and mashed potatoes' it's repulsive what they serve us. maybe I should reduce my meal plan. better check in the morning. I  still have another few minutes. my roommate is asking about cyanide. I guess  that\u2019s what happens when your girlfriend dumps you. tough break. he's been really depressed. he's been like this all evening. I wonder what I\u2019ll do tomorrow. I better get a plan together for what needs to be done. hmmm. I wish I could  get my net access. now I\u2019m pissed. \nAsnwer:"
