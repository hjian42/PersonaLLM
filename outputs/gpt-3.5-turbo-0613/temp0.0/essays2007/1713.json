I have now attended all of my classes for the semester. The first couple days I guess are all just intros and basics and the how to's. Interesting, but I think more interesting is the possibility of what they, the classes, offer for the future. My roomate just left the room to go over to one of her friends rooms. I haven't but briefly met anybody she would have refered to as a friend before she came here, but i think that that would probably give me a better understanding of what she is like. I wish I could type faster, it seems like decades since my typing class in the seventh grade. I can't believe that I am finally 00. It seems like I was the last one of my friends to turn into adult hood or whatever 00 makes me. hey I can vote now,  I still can't legally drink, ummmm I have to pay more for admission to things like ammusment parks. It reminds me of when I turned tweleve and they wouldn't let you eat of the child's menu suddenly. Yeah your still not really old enough, they just call you a teenager, or an adult and take away priveledges without really adding any benefits. My ex boyfriend and I are friends again. but still way weird around each other. my mom just helped me fix my computer after a virus invaded at 00:00 this AM. I was not yet out of class because my tour of the workshop in design class ran just a bit long. one of those oh my god are the seconds actually moving backward kind of ten minutes. Don't worry, I surrived. whooh hooo  it has now been ten minutes. That makes this the hump minute. i guess. My best friend in the whole wide world  yeah look at that alliteration   always called the fourth hour in our shift the hump hour because we were on the downward side of the hill, over the hump, more than half way done. We worked in a child care and i absolutely thought that it was like the best job for eight dollars an hour ever. I love playing with kids, and in fact enjoy acting like one most of the time, but if I was ever tired or not in the mood my only real responsibility was to keep them from hurting themselves or each other   oh and take out the diaper genie. speaking of genies. like the one in the lamp, i must have watched ORGNAME 00 times this summer, a close second to the little mermaid which is still a favorite of mine. I think it would be fun to animate disney movies   except I have a major problem with all the second sequiels I suppose you would call them  yeah this doesn't really have spell check so I guess that will just slip by, or auto correct for that matter, which though often anoying is very helpful  or hurtful for the bad capitalization habits it creates. dun nun nun nun i am excited about my first year at ut and about architecture and about meeting new people. My roomate seems nice, very considerate, always a good thing. I am not totally thrilled that i didn't get to move out of LOCNAME given that I grew up here and in fact lived on the same street my entire life. It is different riding the bus instead driving my car around. I feel like i have so much new freedom, but that the car being out of the picture took away a very different freedom. I know navigation by roads, however not so well yet by capital metro numbers and colored lines. . hey its free   it only took me an hour start to finish to get home today. it was about six oclock. that means some of it was traffic, but i estimate it takes about 00 to 00 minutes longer to get ala me casa. \nAsnwer:"
