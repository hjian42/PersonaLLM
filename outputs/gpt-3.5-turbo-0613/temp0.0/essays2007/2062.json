That sandwich for lunch really hit the spot and now I feel really comfortable as I sit in this chair and look at the screen. I feel somewhat hypnotized and just relaxed. I feel like taking a nap because the temperature is slightly warm and it is making me slow down. I'm thinking about going to gregory but I feel so relaxed that I probably won't go. Its such a long walk and then I have to come back to my room before I go to another class. I wish my dorm room was closer to PROPNAME, then I think I would go more often. Instead I always tell myself I'm going to go but most of the time I just put it off. My back is sore and I think I need to stretch it, my legs are also sore. I know it has to be from all the walking in between classes. I can't wait for tonight. Monday night football. My night to sit on the couch and watch TV. I wonder who is playing. I think its the eagles and ORGNAME, but I'm not sure. I think the ORGNAME have a real good shot of repeating and winning the super bowl again this year. I know for sure the ORGNAME are going to be bad. They will finish around 0 to 0 wins. If they win more, it will be a successful year for them. I wonder where my roommate is. He always leaves the lights on in our room, so I know he has been home and left already. I really wish I was done for the rest of the day and didn't have another class. I would definitely take a nap. Naps are so key. They are rejuvenating beyond anything else. My hair is always in my eyes. I think its time for me to finally get it cut. Its annoying now, its too hot to have long hair in my face. Also it looks kind of shaggy. I'm taking my shoes off. That feels better. ooh. that blister on the bottom of my foot looks pretty bad. ill have to put another band aide on it. I need to start playing basketball more so I won't get blisters when I just play on occasions. The only problem is that there are usually too many people that want to play, so I never get the chance to practice my shot. So in the games I end up missing most of the time. Fortunately the competition is not real high at PROPNAME. Although I have seen PROPNAME PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME up there at times. I can't believe the basketball coach would allow them to play in pickup games like that. What if they got hurt? He would be infuriated. How would you tell the coach that you broke your ankle and were out for the season just because you were in some stupid pickup game. Does not sound right. You know what else is not right, Chance Mock starting t quarterback. LOCNAME's offense is so predictable with Chance at QB. Run PROPNAME PROPNAME up the middle once or twice for minimal yardage and then we are in a third and long and everybody in the stadium knows we have to throw it. That is when Chance gets sacked or throws an incomplete pass and we have to punt it. On the other hand when PROPNAME PROPNAME is at QB, you can't predict what is going to happen. He is much more of a threat. He can run, scramble, elude tacklers and throw also, at least that is what he did against ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME I know its the aggies of LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME that we played last week but he did better than Chance Mock against the same guys. So I think he deserves the start against LOCNAME this upcoming week. I can't wait to rub it into PROPNAME's face when we beat them. I hope he finds a ticket and can come down from LOCNAME for the game. He will definitely be intimidated by the LOCNAME crowd. How long has it been since I have done my laundry?  Not since I left home I think. I really don't want to do laundry in my dorm room. It takes too long. I think I'm just going to take all my dirty clothes with me whenever I go home. Probably around homecoming, which is the same weekend as the ORGNAME ORGNAME game. I can't believe I didn't get a ticket for that. That really pisses me off. I did get lucky though with my season tickets, section 00 row 0, right behind the cannon. That was a pretty good draw for a freshman. Still, Ill have to find a way to get a ticket to the ORGNAME ORGNAME game. Best game all year in all of college football and we better win this year or else PROPNAME PROPNAME should be fired. That would be the fourth year in a row. He can recruit like its nobody's business but he can't develop that talent and fit them into a game plan that can make us win the big game. Straight up he gets out coached every time by PROPNAME PROPNAME. What a stud. My fingers are getting a little tired from typing. \nAsnwer:"
