No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: crit. term; it is weird how we hold on to memories; or even more depressing is the idea that I often want something so bad only to realize, why'd I make such a big deal in the first place?  regardless, I caught a lot of criticism from people in my town on attending ORGNAME; I come from the \"bible belt\" and well UT@Austin is not the ideal \"institution\" in that I was often told \"they are really liberal up there\" or \"watch out for those weirdos\"; ironically the bible belt has one of the highest alcoholic rates around, goes to show how prevalent hypocrisy is no? that goes to say; oh I am reminded of Plato/Aristotle's \"allegory of the cave\"; I say UT as a place to \"get out of my cave\" and as PROPNAME PROPNAME says, \"you can never go home again\" semmingly depressing at first, this statement became quite refreshing to me;; I mean aren't I here to \"find myself\"; it is weird I made such a big deal about being one of the like 0% that will not change their major (business) but now I really want to major in English and Theatre and teach; however it is quite a \"campus issue\" in that my parents want me to do business; in a way expectations can be bad, I mean think about it, when people expect too much from an individual they feel obligated to live up to those expectations in which failure is not an option *sigh*; and is never being satisfied a bad thing? if someone \"settles\" for something are they compromising themselves? or just being content? or can it actually become an obsession in which you never get anything accomplished? be that as it may I think one should never put themselves in compromising situations; like my two really good friends, who are girls, I often hear stories about how nice a guy was to them. I get soo aggravated because I know the guy is just \"giving them a line\"; sadly, I relish in the idea of \"I told you so\" and I often make or ask my friends to humor me and say \"cornell is right, cornell is always right\"; these two friends are high school friends and that is definitely a dominant fear in my life as of yet; they say you never really keep in touch with you hs friends but rather that you make all your friends in college; oh well \"que sera sera\" or something; oh PROPNAME PROPNAME, music is slowly losing its place or relevance in society; I was raised on 00's and 00's music; I love to find people my age who know songs from that age. I'm soo AFTER my time. :); I think that life exp. shape a person; I mean the first five years of my life are a blurr (misspelled that word in a 0th grade spelling bee *sigh*, but I beat our hs valedictorian that year. hehehe) anyway due to like divorce and other problems I don't feel like disclosing; I fell I matured more quickly than others my age who come from \"functional families\" or whatever; my favortie saying is \"well if I'm too big for my britches, it's time for a new pair of pants\" (I made that up. good no?); and furthermore I think that people are brought together by life exp. For example, my \"lunch table\" consisted of people/friends that were all from broken homes. but I can honestly say it is pretty neat now because as a result of divorce I have two great sets of parents; and with my parents the respect is still there, yet is like we are all like friends; I can tell my parents anything. well not anything; but it's like we have \"grown up\" conversations and stuff; and those who are sheltered are really going to have a hard time in life. because out of resent and curiosity they are or may go crazy after hs. hmmmmm that's just my opinion I could be wrong. but that very seldom happens :) \nAsnwer:"
