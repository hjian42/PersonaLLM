I am taking all my classes, and I am doing reasonably well in them. My calculus class does not seem to be too bad except for the fact that the professor pretty much gives us the book word for word in the form of notes except with indeeds and such that is thrown in there. My Sociology class is pretty good, the professor is a nice lady and is very enjoyable to listen to. We discuss all sorts of interesting topics and the favorite one of hers is that there are more than one genders. My Chemistry lab is a 0 hour class and it is ok so far, but we have only done a basic lab to measure the density of coke versus diet coke. I still have to write up the lab report but that would not be too difficult to do. My ORGNAME ORGNAME class is very laid back to the point where it is disturbing. We have 0 class meeting a week for a 0 hour period with many of the classes not being taught by the professor, but by other members of the Chemical Engineering department. There is no final and we end the class in November. To me that just seems a little disturbing. My psychology class is not too bad except for the fact that it is in a huge auditorium that for the most part is very dimly lit. The atmosphere in it is not very helpful to students who are tired after all there classes because it does seem to make falling asleep a whole lot easier. The material covered in the lectures is all very familiar to me as I did take ORGNAME ORGNAME in high school and I have kept all of my notes from the class. Unfortunately I only managed to make a 0 on the AP exam so I did not get credit. One thing I am contemplating right now is whether it is wise for me to be taking two social science classes when my degree plan only requires me to take one. I have taken Psychology before and I found it to be very interesting, but right now Sociology is coming out to be much more entertaining and the homework assignments are to watch two good movies (One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Empire of the Sun) and to write a short paper on them regarding the sociological ideas in the movies. Currently I just got off work from the Blockbuster on LOCNAME street where I had a nice night except for the fact that my brother called me on his cell from LOCNAME saying he had run away from home. That was pretty weird when I found out he had run away and what was the cause of it. I did find out that it was all about an assignment that his lacrosse coach had given him and the assignment was an extremely religious one (my brother is an atheist). The coach said that the players were free to give him a book to read on a conflicting point of view, and my brother chose to give him a book entitled Atheism, the case against God\". My parents were extremely mad at him and called him an intolerant asshole. My brother overreacted and called them assholes and said that he did not need parents anymore since they weren't really helping him out. My brother's views on God are basically that there is no God and he doesn't really care what others think about his views on religion. He also doesn't try to convince them of the fact that there is no god, he is merely doing as his coach suggested, providing a book with a conflicting view (my brother hasn't even read the book). I pretty much told PROPNAME to take a walk and go get a soda so he could cool off for the evening and then head home if my dad hadn't found him yet. One thing about my family is that we are all very stubborn and don't back down from the views we care about. It leads to a lot of fights. After I finish this writing assignment, I have plans to play this really addictive computer game called Civilization III. In the game, you build an empire from 0000BC and research all sorts of technology, manage cities, wage war, and survive. In the current game I have going, I am playing as PROPNAME of the Carthaginians, and my enemies are PROPNAME of LOCNAME, PROPNAME of LOCNAME, and PROPNAME of LOCNAME. Currently I am at war with everyone and in the process of wiping out LOCNAME. My armies have been battling LOCNAME for the past 0 hours of game play time which in years of the game is from the period of 0000 approximately to 0000. It is only since 0000 that I have managed to conquer many cities. LOCNAME and LOCNAME were at peace with me until I launched two tactical nukes at the Greek cities. The declared war on me and I am not sure why. I did make an official declaration of war against LOCNAME and then they attacked me. So now I am building modern armors (good tanks) by the hundreds, working with a communist form of government and I am going to eliminate greece before I wipe the rest of the world out. The only reason I am doing so well is that I have better technology than the rest of them and superior numbers. The can just move faster in their own territory, but I will conquer. I even have a nuke prepared to fire on LOCNAME when I start to take them on. Farewell, I am off to conquer the world. \nAsnwer:"
