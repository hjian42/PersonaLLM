No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: this is now the third time I am writing this paper and I am honestly pretty sick of it. the first time I wrote this, I hit a delete button and erased my entire paper. the second time, the system went down so I couldn't submit my writing. hopefully this time everything will go as planned. I don't really pay much attention usually to how thoughts enter my mind but I think I know generally how my mind works. as long as there is nothing around me stimulating my thoughts I generally think about my insecurities (I am always thinking about how things could be different if say, I were prettier, or smarter, or more outgoing, or whatever), singing a song in my head (whether it be from the radio or a commercial), or stressing myself out over a test or something. if I do see something, like a young couple walking a dog in a park for example, I first take the event for what it is. t might think to myself \"oh what a cute couple\" or \"that is a cute dog. \" as the event passes though, I tend to relate whatever I just saw to me personally. I would probably think to myself, \"I want to get a dog once I get my own apartment. \" my thoughts would quickly digress as I would think of other things I could do with my own place. I would imagine decorating the walls, planting a garden, or even in what part of the city I would want my place to be in. my point is that my thoughts rarely stay on one subject matter. I quickly move from one thing to another, forgetting about whatever it was that I was just thinking about. thoughts simply lead to other thoughts, with one small detail changing the mind track completely. \nAsnwer:"
