No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: tomorrw i finally get to go home!!! its homecoming and one of my friends running for queen. college is a great exerience so far, but there is a lot of reading, but on the flip side there is also a lot of parties. I've met a lot of fun people. oh my goodness, i get my hair cut this weekend!!!! i am so excited. this is as long as I've had it in a long time. im so glad to get out of my home town. its so small and so judgmental. every one knows every thing about every one in the town. just the other day an article was written to high school extra about how horrible the coaches in my home town were and some slandering was going on and now there are lawyers and police involved. oh well i guess im not involved in that, thank god. this psy class is interesting and thank god for that, because if not i would prob. fail the course. wow ntwenty min is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say, and that is not usually the case. most of the time i can't quit talking and never find it hard to think of another subject to talk about. i don't have a boyfrien and thats because i don't like answering to people and thats what a high school relationship is. my best frien dane, he was almost a boyfriend, we could never decide what we wanted to do and until a week before he left to college and now he plays football there so i realy never get to see him. but we still stay in contact. foolish pride i guess. well that and i was never able to stay commited and i guess that was the real problem. i didnt want to be held down and i know thats what it would have been like so i just avoided it. scared of commitment? a little but who isn't. plus why just have one when you can have many and more. i sound like the typical guy, but i whos to judge.  \nAsnwer:"
