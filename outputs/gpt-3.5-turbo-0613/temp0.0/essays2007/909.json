No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I wonder what this assignment is about. the tv is on and some stupid commercial is going on I need to go get some dinner by 0:00. wow that's a nice car on tv, I need to earn some money so I can get a better car. that reminds me my car is still broken down at taco bell and I need to call them and tell them not to tow it or I need to get it towed to a shop like the pep boys across the street man cars suck when they're not running I really wish I had lots of cash so I could buy a more reliable newer one I should call that guy tomorrow about the job so I can earn more money my mind hit a blank spot where I can't really think about anything. then how am I typing if I'm not paying attention to anything? I must be paying attention to something because I'm typing or maye I'm just doing it unconsciously I'm thirsty I need to get something to drink but I can't leave my desk ther's some water right there I'm goin to grab it as soon as I finish this thought how long has it been? only 0 or 0 minutes I need to organize my thoughts and my bedroom, they're both messy that pizza on tv looks really good hey I have a coupon for a free pizza maybe I should order one I wonder if they will deliver a free pizza or they will probably make me pick it up how far is the nearest pizza hut I think only a few blocks away but I should save that for when I'm out of cash and really tired of dorm food I think I already am tired of it but I will be more tired of it in a few weeks my eyes are kind of itchy I guess it's probably allergies saturday night live is on tv it's pretty funny I wonder what it would be like to be in the saturday night live cast I bet there are all kind of hidden relationships and tensions between the characters that go on behind the scenes like with PROPNAME PROPNAME from the older cast how much time has passed I've got about 0 minutes left then I will stop and look at the second assignment and if it won't take too long then I'll do it before dinner but if not I probably wont get to it for a few days because of all of the things I have to do in the next few days let me figure out what I need to do. I need to get my books, call that guy, deal with my car, clean my room, e-mail my friend from high school, check to see if my camera has arrived if not I need to e-mail that guy and see what's taking so long what are they doing on tv that's strange what else do I need to do lets see. I need to go to my classes and go get some groceries, talk to my parents about the money I owe them damn I need to find a way to get lots of cash to repay my debts and buy some of the stuff I've wanted for so long I haven't actually bought anything I just wanted to buy in probably a year because of all the money I owe I should have worked more last summer but I guess its ok that I didn't because I was sick for most of it I'm so tired of getting sick it really makes me angry and tense about things ok what time is it okay I've been writing for about 00 minutes I guess that's enough now I'm going to stop this and finish up this assignment \nAsnwer:"
