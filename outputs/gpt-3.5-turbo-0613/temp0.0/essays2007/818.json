LOCNAME is playing PROPNAME in football and I have some friends who play for PROPNAME. I have not seen these friends since this summer. I have only seen them on t. v. when they got killed my LOCNAME last week. I hope that they play better this week. I feel bad saying it, but I kind of hope PROPNAME wins. I know it sounds terrible, but they are my friens & one of the players is my ex-boyfriend, but we are still good friends. I am most excited about seeing him. I talk to him on the phone occasinaly, but I have not seen him in person since July. We lived about 00 minutes away from each other and that made it kind of hard to see each other - that is why we broke up. The way we met was pretty cool. Every year my home town (LOCNAME) has a BBQ Cook Off. Let me tell you it is so much fun - I look forward to it each year. My dad has had a team in the cook off ever since I can remember. Anyway, before the cook off last March a lot of my friends went over to my friends apartment. One of my friends who plays football for PROPNAME was coming down and he was bringing a lot of his friends with him. They all showed up at the apartment and we left for the cook off. My friends and I thought this one guy was so cute & he ended up driving my best friend and me to the cook off. I talked to him some that night, but then he and his friends all went back to LOCNAME. Months went by and I graduated high school and for my senior trip we went to LOCNAME. We had been there for a few days and one of my friends on the trip with me told me that he had just ran into \"the cute guy from the cook off\" down stairs. I couldn't believe it. He just happened to be in LOCNAME at the same time as me & he was staying in the same hotel. We all ended up meeting and going out together & we had so much fun. Ever since then we have talked and become really good friends. I guess that is why I am so excited about this weekend. \nAsnwer:"
