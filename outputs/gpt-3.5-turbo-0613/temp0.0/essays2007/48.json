I'm pretty sleepy too, I'm in  Longhorn band, so I had practice last night until about 0:00. Then I went  to a freshman meeting and decided to run for freshman representative. Believe  it or not, I actually won. It surprised me a lot because I don't know anyone. I've met lots of people, but I don't really have any good friends there. It makes  me really happy. I feel like I can now establish myself there and be a  leader in ORGNAME. This assignment is pretty weird because I really do write like this in my spare time. Whenever I get stressed, I usually grab a notebook and just write  everything that comes to mind. This is different though, it's a little harder to type your feelings. It somehow loses some emotion or something. There's really not much stress in my life right now, except the usual  going to college stuff, but I'll write about that later. My French horn teacher was really mean to me on Wednesday. He's this  little old man that looks kind of like PROPNAME. He always wears bolo ties and well, he's just a little jerk. He enjoys watching his students cry and have emotional breakdowns. We'll see!  I've never let him see me cry and I never will. I think he sees me as a challenge. I mean, he's really talented and of coarse I have lots of respect for him. I just don't  understand why he enjoys hurting people so much. There is a picture of my boyfriend and me on the wall. I like it. (I actually look decent in it) I always look ugly in pictures. I have this  friend that always comes out pretty in pictures. I'm jealous. Well, I've surpassed my 00 minutes, so I better go. \nAsnwer:"
