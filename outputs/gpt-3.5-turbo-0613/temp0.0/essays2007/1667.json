No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      why am i nervous about this assignment, it can't be wrong, i feel like i'm writing so randomly, i'm usually so structured, or am i , i really haven't been lately, i'm so lazy sometimes, like today i didn't want to go to physics class and i just didn't wake up, i think i turned my alarm off, but i'm not 000% sure, i really don't like early early classes, it's such a bum to get up for them, on and on and on, and even if they don't go on like that, it's just such a pain having to get up for them, i mean it's so blessed early, 0:00 in the blamin morning, i mean come on, who wants to be studying physics at that time of morning, it's way to early, way too early, and u'd think that with all the money the university has, it could  get some professors who speak good english, not that they don't know what they're talking about or anything like that, it just seems a little out of place, that's all, this place sure is a mixing pot, names i've never seen before and many i'll bever be able to pronounce, so many people, so many names, just going down the hall and meeting some random person and talking for hours, and bam! u have a friend, or two, or 0 as the case may be, i mean sheesh, this is the place to be, there's just so much to do that u never feel like doing your homework, except this assignment, i actually like this one, it has purposed guised beneath it's apparent randomidity, i really should reconsider my major, i can't stand to get up for calculus, i dread physics and i loath chemistry, but when it comes to things like psychology, government, history, english, i can't wait to get to class, i don't despise having to get to know enough to pass the blamin test, i teach it to others, spend spare time to find the little intricate details that so intrigue my intellect, the adjectives and grammatical spurts that titilate the mind as opposed to the numbers and inferences that wear on one's nerves like grating concrete on your skull, one's a vacation and one's imprisonment, i really should get more sleep, i'm having trouble typing straight, or maybe it's just the rediculously small amount of space i have to write on this little desk with my frankenstein computer, how am i going to afford my chem book,no, not chem, my philosophy book, whoops, great one to put on here, they now think i'm horrible, no i really love psych, i even had it in high school, just haven't gotten the book yet, have to go to the financial aid office to get my mess straightened out, then got to do my blinkin physics homework tonight, jeez, and i've got to get the stupid dart transit thing worked out, they really need more hours in the day or some thing like that, everyone wants money and almost noone will come to dinner, people say they'll call and never do, people say they'll stop by and never do, do i need a message board? will anyone actually use it, or will people erase it if they do? am i paranoid? it's possible, in most cases i'm just prepared and my wrists are getting a little tired from typing in this awkward position, that is with this numbskull desk here, i'll probably get carpal tunnell or something, see even my spelling's going, that's what too much math will do to a person, i honestly don't understand this new calculus course i'm in, since when do mathemeticians make INFERENCES, in these problems we're having to make a whole string of INFERENCES to come a concrete answer? i think not! math is supposed to be about numbers and certainties and the correct technical notation which my TA and professor seem to think is unneccessary, IT IS NECESSARY, i mean come on here, u can't just start putting stuff down and have it be correct, if u don't define it right it could mean anything, i've seen sounder arguments made against abortion in philosophy class than i've seen arguments made for what some limit or sequence is, i thought math was supposed to be the one infallible, untouchable truth because it relied on cold hard unchangeable numbers, but NO, i'm in stinking cal 0 and i've hardly seen a solid number yet, most of what i've seen is shifty half arguments that if used in a court case would set a criminal off scott free, and they claim it to be the language of the universe? if that's so then it's just a confusing and complex a language as english because there's always some exception, some little thing that messes you up, some minor, minute, miniscule tidbit that u miss that makes the entire thing false, give me a break people, and as if it were easy to pay attention in class anyway, with the shorts and shirts the fine ORGNAME woment wear, it's a wonder any studying gets done at all, and in the one class i do have a relatively subdued female population, i have a professor that seems like everybody's grandpa and does nothing but write formulas on the board and make side comments about important rules that are already supposed to be common knowledge, NO they are not common knowledge, maybe to u, but u already HAVE your stinkin PhD, we haven't even gotten a bachelor's yet, so stop your assuming, jeez i'm thirsty, u'd think i'd been yelling all this at someone for the past 00 minutes for as dry as my mouth is, in all honesty if someone took the time they could probably findout who wrote this if they really wanted to, it's not like i haven't given enough clues already, well i'm just in the hope and confidence that they won't, oh look, time's almost up, well that was a productive venting section, now if we could only fix all of these problems, oh well, life is life and that's the way it goes, we'll just have to deal \nAsnwer:"
