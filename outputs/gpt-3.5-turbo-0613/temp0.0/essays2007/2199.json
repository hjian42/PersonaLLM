But I am enjoying listening to the music that she is playing. That is one thing I miss about not driving anymore. I don't get to listen to music all the time. It is really weird not having a radio in my room, I even find myself just purposely stalling around the bathroom in my dorm longer than normal just so I can listen to the radio that is in there. I am starting to realize how random my thoughts are. As many times I have joked around about it but I really think that I have ADD. Now I am thinking that I really need to call this girl back. She called while I was eating dinner with a friend over at Kinsolving. I think that I am purposely stalling before calling her back. She asked for my number at this club, but everytime I think about I can't get over the fact that I kind of met someone at a club and the fact that stereotypes are funny. She is this kind of manly lesbian who is in the army and everytime I think about I just think it is really funny. Now I am thinking about my roommate and that she listens to good music. She is playing Third Eye Blind\", which is my favorite band. Now I'm trying I'm remembering that this is the 0rd track on their 0nd album, \"Blue\". Now I'm trying to restrain myself from singing the song for the reason that I don't want to distract my roomie from studying or scare her with my terrible singing. Now I'm thinking that I really need to break/stop this clock thing of mine from beeping 0 minutes past every hour. I used to just ignore it but now it is really starting to bother me. I should find the instruction manual that or throw it away, I don't have patience for those kind of things, which is actually kind of terrible considering that I am currently an engineering major. Now I can't help ignoring the knot in my stomach, I'm nervous about something but I can't really narrow it down. I think it is a combination of calling this girl and the mostly ever present stress and pressure I feel from the whole classes/college thing. I'm really glad that prof. pennebaker taking about that in class today (that it is normal for college freshman to feel this way) I thought I might just have been being really weird and stressing out, which isn't too normal during this time of year. There is something about switching from the summer mode to school mode that always seems to stress me out. Now I just seem to be spacing out and not really thinking about anything. I'm trying to figure out if I am really tired or if it is just the stress that is making me feel this way. But at least it is a pleasant break the \"dissecting my life\" thoughts that I have been having lately. For the last two days I have been trying to figure out whether my lack of a party life was caused by me being a mature high schooler or my me just being naive. I'm starting to realize that I think I need to cut ties with my dad again. the drama just isn't worth it. I think he . sorry I'm distracted. my roomie is playing the \"Turning Japanese Song\". now I just had a vision of my mom dancing and singing this song. ohh, more 00's music  PROPNAME PROPNAME's \"Beat it\". wow, he is such a freak now. anyway. where was I?  oh \nAsnwer:"
