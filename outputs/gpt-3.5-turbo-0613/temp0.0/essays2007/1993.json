No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I just woke up but I'm still sleepy. naps are so great! especially when you are sick. I can't believe that I've been sick all week long. I can't believe I missed that much class. I hope it's ok. I should be. college isn't like high school. thank God. there is so much more free time here. but I need to spend some of it studying. I'm nervous about all of my first tests! I hope I can handle them. I mean, I made good grades in high school but that is nothing compared to this level. oh well. grades can't be everything. if they were, I'd end up like my roommate. oh God. I've never met anyone like her. ever. how can anyone possibly be so boring? wow, speaking of the devil she just walked in! that always happens to me! everytime I talk about or mention someone they either walk up or call me. it's rather creepy. anyway. eww! I just remembered that we have geckos in our dorm room! it's so gross! well. they are actually kind of cute, but just not in my room. I need to take it out from under that cup before it suffocates. I would hate to kill it. poor thing is probably scared to death. either that or REALLY bored, I mean it's been in that small prison for a day now. but then again, my roommate sits in our small prison for days & never gets bored. I'm so mean. but it is seriously driving me insane! I mean give me a break, I walk in and she is just sitting there. no lights, no music, no TV. just staring at the wall. how creepy. but she doesn't mind. I mean I try to get her come places with me but she is never interested. oh well. whatever floats her boat. but what does? it seems that nothing does. I mean I can tell you I like this song or I like this food. she has nothing that she likes. nothing that she is passionate about. I do like this song actually. I like weezer. its somewhat mellow but not enough to make me want to sleep. a good transition from taking a nap to waking up. its perfect for right now. lyrics: lets go away for a while, you & I, to a strange & misty land. \" I really need to take a trip to visit jeff, heather, & tim. I don't understand how all of my favorite people in the whole world all decide to disperse themselves across the nation just to go to school. I'm so jealous! heather gets to go to NYC just for the weekends! that is going to be awesome to go see her on thanksgiving. I really want to go see jeff in alabama too. I need to go watch one of his baseball games. he is so good! I am so proud of him! I'm sad that he isn't here though. I wish he was taller. I know if he was that he could definitely go pro. they say he has a chance even now! that is so great! that would be his dream come true. I hope he makes it. but I hope I still get to see him. I really miss him. I miss tim too. but what is in kentucky?  \nAsnwer:"
