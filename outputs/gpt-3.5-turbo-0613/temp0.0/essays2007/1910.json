I think I would feel better if I could just take my eyes out of my head. It's cold in here. My finger itches and I don't know why. It won't stop and its affecting my writing. I hope I used the right form of ?affect? in that last sentence. I hope I don't have any spelling errors either. I have so many things to study and I'm trying to figure out when I can do it all. There's a really cool show on the TV that's on about mummies. It's very interesting. I think I missed PROPNAME and PROPNAME on the Cartoon Network today. My finger stopped itching. Now my arm itches (and I'm not making this up just to copy the example in class), it really does itch. I need to pay some bills later. I just want to go to sleep right now. I hope I will go to sleep tonight because I couldn't last night. My arm stopped itching. I don't know what else to write and I've still got 00 minutes left. Boy, this is taking a long time. Now the TV is on some stupid show and I would change it but I have to keep typing. I think I'll take a nap after this so I don't fall asleep in class. That LOCNAME LOCNAME I had for lunch was really good. I'll need to drink so more water before I go back out in the heat or I'll collapse. This humidity kills me. Walking around campus is very good exercise though. I need to remember to take my calculator to math Friday. Well, that's almost 0 more minutes. I mean, it's not a bad writing assignment, its just feels so monotonous. I had to pop my fingers a second. I probably should call my cousin who lives in LOCNAME, but I really don't want her to be over here all the time least she find out where I live. That reminds me, I need to go switch my meal card later and check my voice mail. 0 minutes to go. I hope you don't think I'm crazy by reading this but you probably do so, oh well. 0 more minute. 0 more minute ten I can take a nap. Almost there. 00 seconds. THE END \nAsnwer:"
