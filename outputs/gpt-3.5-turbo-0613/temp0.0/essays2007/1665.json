I don't know that I can come up with anything to write about. I really should be studying for spanish becausse that class is a lot harder but I guess I don't have to do it right now. Tomorrow is Tuesday so I don't even have to do this now but I guess it will be one less thing to do later. Somebody is moving furntiture next door and it sounds like guy's voices. This is an all girl dorm so they are breaking a rule. No boys in the dorm!!  That's a funny rule- like it really keeps people from doing stuff they shouldn't. Wow two minutes already! I guess it is going a little faster that I thought it would. I'm really tired - I need to sleep more. At least my room is really clean. My fish is staring at me. His name is Moby like from the book. I don't even know what the book is about-isn't that retarded that I am in college and never read moby dick?   Our educations system today. . I need to get deej a b-day gift soon- I think her b-day is on thursday. Shes getting up there in age really fast. I wonder what my mom is doing right now. She is off today because it's labor day. I feel like I have a lot to do but I guess I really don't. This week should go super fast I'm hoping. I need to do Math homework too that is really important. PROPNAME should be back ssoon. I wonder how I'm going to talk to her and keep typing at the same time. I wonder what all this means. I bett this stupid computer is going to tell me some deep psychological thing about myself after this is done although I have discussed nothing profound. I'm tired of typing. I could go a head and stop and just let the timer keep going but that would be cheating and you probabably know that.  I need good grades. This is so boring my eyes are drooping!!  I want sleep on my nicne new soft bed. I bet my mom spent SO much money on that bed. I have to do my defensive driving thing soon before I get halled off to jail. I don't know when I'm going to find time for that. I need a job. Their were so many cute clothes at the mall today. I need to shop but I don't want to spend money. I'm cheap. Oh, well. I'm really worried about my cell phone bill. Maybe the verizon webpage will tell me some stuff. Man I'm not even halfway through with this assignment. I wonder what the purpose is. I'm really tired and I'm falling  asleep right now. Ahhh!   Hurry up!  I don't want to do this anymore. I wonder what people do who can't really type. Our refrigerator is really noisy. I think it would be funny ot read someone elses thing. this is going to be REALLY long Sorry, I need a drink on pepsi. I had to take a breather. I wonder if those reabate things really get you money back. I'm glad that I'm going to know my course load down to only 00 hours. 00 is really to many. Modern will be relatively easy and I  m thinking I can do well in this class if I really try hard. I wonder if I could get a job at one of the hospitals or something. I really need to call Aunt PROPNAME tonight. I sjhould make that a priority. I need to also find out information about the dance stuff  I want to do. I will have to diet this week. Yuck!  I am bored bored bored. My room is really cute now. I like my fish and picutes and the colors. I musht admit that it is way cute. I have so many picutes. I like the ledge along my wall- that hlp a lot. I want to decorate my bublletin board too. Maybe I can get some stuff this weekend. We need a full length mirror for out room. We need it really baddly too. they do really crappy paint jobs in here. It looks terrible!!  the can't evin keep it on the wall. My desk looks brand new though. It is really cold in there- I don't like it. My fish is staring at me. I think he thinks I'm and idiot. I fed him today but maybe a little too much. I know you can over feeed them. I'd love to get more but I think they kill eachother. Myabe I could get a female and they could breed fish. That would be really cute. I could sell the babies for 0 bucks a piece. Yeah!! I'm almost done. My lege hurts- maybe I have shin splints. I have been running so much latly. I need to go tonight. I should have read the part of the book that corresponds with this lesson so that I would know what all this means and WHY we actually have to type for so long. ONly one more minute left. PROPNAME isn't back yet. Oh hurry up I want to be DONE. My fingsrs are numb it is so cold in this room. I want my bed now!! only a couple more seconds and I will be done with this assighnment. I hope I like this class! \nAsnwer:"
