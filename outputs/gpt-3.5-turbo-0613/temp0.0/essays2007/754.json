No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have way too much to do this week I am never going to get all of it done it's amazing that I have this 00 min to do this one assignment it is a good thing that the deadline was postponed today in class. PROPNAME who lives in my dorm is in my class, that is cool, now I have someone to sit with. I need to study, I need to sleep, I fell asleep in the laundry room today. That's poor. At least my laundry's done. Tonight I have to be in my room at 00 because my Sailor Sis is going to come do something to me or something. I am glad I'm here instead of home. Home sucks. It is fun here and believe it or not less stressful maybe not less stressful but definietley less depressing. I'm hungry but I  have ot wait until 0:00. I also have to go take REality Bites back to that girl that PROPNAME knows who lives on my floor. I wish PROPNAME didn't have another one of those damn mixers so she could study with me tonight, I have a mixer tomorrow when she will want to study. I better clean my room I bet my roomate thinks I am a pig. Oh well get used to it. Man, I've only been writing a little while. Psy is a good class though. no I'm not sucking up. I like it it's interesting and lightly entertaining. Bad time of day though-during when I want ot take a nap. Wed. is a long day, when is the weekend coming again?  Oh how I've missed the weekend. My stomach hurts, not from hunger but from ab machines. I just noticed that when I sneezed just now. I need to keep the discipline up with those ab machines though there is nooo way that I'm gaining the freshmen fifteen. I've actually lost five lbs. according to the scale back in LOCNAME. Maybe that is because I don't eat as much because the food sucks. I'm actually eating more down here because I'm not depressed anymore. In LOCNAME, after my dad's death I couldn't eat. We sort of talked about that today in class--stress can shut down the stomach because we can live off of glucose in our livers--and I am sure that is what happened to me this  summer. So maybe I should perceive my hunger as a lack of stress. Perhaps that is the optimistic point of view--perhaps that is the lazy ignorant point of view. Whatever  My arms hurt, I'm tired of typing. I kind of like this form of writing you know where I can just say anything. Is this like therapy or something? I always thought this was the kind of stuff therapists make their patients do. The next assignment is probably to draw a picture or something. Something that expresses my \"feelings\". Enough sarcasm. I feel like I have to burp maybe I drank to much coke. AT least I won't go through withdrawal. I wish PROPNAME wouldn't go play basketball before we eat--I'm hungry. Maybe I'm just bored. Lots of people say that overeaters just eat when they are bored because they cannot think of anything else to do. Jeopardy is on. I got a free t shirt last night at PROPNAME becuase they were filming College jepardy or someting. It looked like a few geeks in front of a camera just standing there with loud music. I never actually figured out what is going on . Hey that is cool  PROPNAME just called and wants to eat. It is a shame I have to keep writing this for 00 more minutes. no wait five more. YES. I kind of like this its cool. I got nop email today. That pisses me off. I love email. The only thing in the real mail today was some anonymous letter about a credit card or some kind of BS like that. I already have a credit card. Phone is ringing again. Food its almost time for food. I wonder why PROPNAME didn't play basketball. Maybe he did. Nah he wouldn't do that for 00 min. It probably sounds like I care a lot about PROPNAME but I don't that is my friend's man. PROPNAME's man. He is crazy about her. It is all good though he is a nice guy and they go together weell. College rules. I think the water here in LOCNAME infected my bellybutton ring though. It's been oozing ever since I got here. I haven't changed the way I'm taking care of it but I don't know. Hey I only have a little time left. because I started at 0:00 and now the clock ahs just turned to 0:00 This is me signing out. \nAsnwer:"
