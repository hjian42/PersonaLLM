No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: well, topday when I was sitting in the cafeteria, I was thinking about something. my roommate mike, said to me, \"congratulations for not cursing for over a certain period of time. \"  that was kinda strange because I don't usually curse until I came onto this campus. I have no idea why. he asked me if I did it at home a lot, but the truth is, no I don't. I don't usually curse. the only time I ever did that was if I felt pain or something. I never felt the need to curse and I know that it's a filthy habit. I also know that it's not a very classy thing to do. I can't figure it out. I have noticed that I curse a lot and I've made attempts to stop. but the truth is, I don't really want to because it's fun. I don't to it often enough. well, at least that's the conclusion I came up with. that's really been the only thing on my mind other than girls and big breast and stuff like that. that's kind strange too, because I know that it's not important to me. it's actually very superficial, but I don't care. I have fun talking in vulgar manners to my friends and stuff like that but that's not me at all. I know that it's not but I can't stop sometimes. well, I can but I choose not too. . FIRE DRILLL!!!  oh well. last I left off was awhile ago. I kinda lost train of thought. I don't remember what I wrote and I don't feel like reading what I wrote. now I feel kinda tired because I walked up the 00 flights of stairs. I wasn't as tiring for me as it was for my friends. I'm expecting some letters from my little sister. she's suppose to send me some important stuff like my id and credit card and stuff like that. I'm kinda worried because if someone steals the credit card, I'll be in big trouble.  a couple of my friends do drugs and have already had sex and stuff like that. I hate to pass judgements and crap like that so I pretend that it's all good. I don't even know if it's a good a idea to confront them about it. well, it's not like they're my friends or anything like that, but I did meet them here. I don't know how confidential this writting assignment is so I don't want to say too much. lets just say that I see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil. I'm not sure what I'm suppose to write about. I know that it's stream of consciouness but if there's nothing on my mind, what am I suppose to write about. the first time I heard about this, I thought about hemingway and his style of writting. students that went to my high school studied hemingway and I at least know that he wrote stream of consciousness.  I wonder if I'm out of breath. would that effect how well I think. cause I'm writing this stupid assignment, and I seem to have trouble because I'm thinking too much about breathing. I always have this huge headache. I think it was because it was hot outside and now it's cold. I don't know. I don't care.  actually, this assignment is kinda of easing because I can just write whatever I want and know that as long as I turn it in, I'm ok. no matter what I say or how I say it, it's all good.  but, when I came in the room after that firedrill, I didn't want to do anything but lie on my bed. I'm sleeping and my mind is wondering off in some weird way. I know I have to write for 00 min. and I have another 0-0 min. to go. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm tired. I'm not even thinking anymore. I got to pee, but I don't want to unless I'm finished with this assignment. man I got to pee. ok, I'm going to end this assignment now that I think I'm done. \nAsnwer:"
