I only had one class today, Philosophy, and it was better than the first time I went. I get scared here. There are so many people and I don't know where I stand yet. It is so much different from where I am from. My hometown is extremely small and everyone knows everyone so coming to LOCNAME was a huge change for me. Everyone seems so smart and everyone seems to know exactly what they are doing, the classes they are taking and everything. I have know idea what I plan on majoring in. Right now I am undeclared, Natural Science and I don't know where that will lead me. Maybe I will figure it out one day though. I am sure I have too. It is so hot outside. My mom told me that it hasn't rained in my hometown in 00 days. I can't believe that. That is so outrageous. She also said that there were grass fires all around our house. That is so scary. I don't want anything to happen to them. We live so far out and all the fires have been our way. It is so scary. My dad works all the time. All he does is work. My parents are both coming down this weekend for the first UT football game. I am so excited. I think it will be a blast. I have gone to tons of games and they are always a blast. I don't understand this friend I have. She has always wanted to go to ORGNAME, ever since she was a little girl. Now, she has this boyfriend who goes to a&m and now she is going to transfer to a&m to be with him. And to top it off, they are getting engaged. She has been with this guy for only three months. I don't understand people sometimes. I mean you think you know someone so well and then one day you think you don't know them at all. There are only a few people from my high school here. I am glad though. I want to meet other people, to broaden my horizon. I didn't know my roommate before I moved here and we get along great. She is so nice and I think we will be pretty good friends. I have this one friend who did come here from my high school and she is negative about everything and everyone and it drives me crazy. She gripes about the sorority stuff and about people going out at night, about people laying out during the day, and just stuff that shouldn't even matter at all. I mean who cares about these people. Let them do what they want and don't criticize them. It is so stupid the way she acts sometimes. She thinks that I am the only one she can hang out with here and I feel bad because I want to go meet more people and do what I want without being criticized for it. I wonder what my brother is doing these days. He lives in LOCNAME LOCNAME and I haven't even talked to him since I have been here. Maybe I will call him today. He is 0 years older than I am. We get along really well, but he has a girlfriend that he is always with so that is another reason why I haven't seen him in a while. I am in this sorority. I don't know if it is me though. I mean I don't know if I want to tie myself down to all of that stuff. It is kind of hard to tell right now though. I will have to give it time I think. If I don't like it I will just drop out. I am so tired these days it seems like I have something to do all the time. Like I never get a chance to just stop what I am doing to rest. I love Austin though and I am really happy here. My boyfriend and I are doing pretty good too. I am glad about that. He lives in LOCNAME and goes to ORGNAME. It is really sad though that we can't be together now and we are so far apart. I don't know really what to do. I cry a lot about it because I love this guy so much and I want everything to work out, but I just don't know how we are going to be able to handle not seeing each other for weeks and weeks at a time. It is horrible. But, I think we can do it. We have been together for 0 years and about 0 months now so I think it is possible. I don't want anyone else either. I mean he is everything I ever wanted so I don't think I should even look for anyone else. He is the best. Plus, guys scare me like all the STDs these days I wouldn't know who was lying to me or who was telling the truth and so I think I will just stay with the guy I have now. Oh, I miss him so much. I have two Chinese pug dogs and I miss them too. College is such a big change. Especially for me, coming to Austin from such a small town. But, I can handle it. \nAsnwer:"
