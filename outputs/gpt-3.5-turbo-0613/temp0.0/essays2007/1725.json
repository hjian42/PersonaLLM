I went there with my friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME to get crafts and other supplies for our Nothing Books. Nothing Books are like scrapbooks, and we have to make them for our sorority, ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I think it's a really cute way ORGNAME making sure we remember our pledge term. Rush week was maybe the most hectic week of my entire life. First of all, we got to LOCNAME on move-in day, and we spent all day, I mean all day long moving into ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was crazy! We took a break to eORGNAME lunch, but the day was insane. Everyone moving in with their boxes and crates, and the move-in equipment that was supplied was hardly efficient. So that night, we started rush, after all that mess. I was so tired and worn out, I could barely walk to the meeting. The rest of that night is kind of a blur; I think I came back to Towers after the meeting and went straight to bed. The rest of the week we had to dress up. The events got more and more dressy each day, and I could swear that the weather got hotter and hotter each day. I think I probably sweat more in those 0 days than I ever have. ever! It was honestly just gross. Really, the whole process of Sorority Rush at this university is ridiculous. I guess I am being a hypocrite, but when you think about it, some sororities will cut you without even getting to know you at all. You think they like you, and they're cheering in your face like they love you, saying all kinds of things, like   we hope to see you tomorrow  , and the next thing you know, they've cut you. I guess I am making it sound like it's an awful experience, when in reality it really wasn't so bad. There were some very entertaining events during rush. My favorite was probably Skit Night, where we were allowed to go back to a maximum of five houses, and at each house they performed their own unique skit to try to get us to come back to their house the next night for Pref Night. Pref Night was probably the most emotional night of the whole week. All of the seniors in the sororities were crying, either because they were excited to get new members the next day, or because they were sad to be leaving. It could have been a combination of both. Immediately after we went to our last three houses that night, we were on complete   silence  . We could not speak to anyone, not our friends, our families, not even people that weren't rushing. It was supposed to be our chance to think about the entire week and to make a decision based on only our personal feelings as to which sorority we wanted to be in. We went back to our group meeting areas for the last time, and we ranked our choices. It was not very hard for me, because I pretty much knew which one I wanted to be in. However, there were tons of girls crying that night, torn over what they should do. I am just glad I was not in that position. That next day was Bid Day, where everyone found out what sorority they actually got into. There was even more crying that day. All around me, girls were screaming and crying, because some of them hadn't gotten into their first choice sorority, and some were just so happy with their bids that they couldn't contain themselves I guess. It was crazy! I was very happy, and when I got out of the building and saw that all of my friends had also been put into my sorority, I was even more ecstatic. Our pledge class is made up of 00 diverse girls who each contribute something different to the sorority. I know I am going to love being in LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. What I don't know is how I am ever going to balance being in a sorority, making good grades in my ORGNAME, Chemistry, Psychology, and Hebrew classes, and partying at this extremely social school. Not to say that I am a real party girl, but I like to go to all the events, and it gets very difficult to stay on track with everything coming at you from different directions all at once. I am glad that I live at Towers with almost all of my friends, because it gives me a chance to not only be with all of them, but also to meet new people. I didn't know my roommate before I came here, and I have met so many people on my hall, or at different sorority and fraternity parties. I like everyone I meet, but I guess at a school with 00,000 students you can't go wrong. I know I made the right choice by going to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. It has everything I could want in a college and more. I love it here!! And I especially love my styrofoam orange longhorn ears that I got at the co-op when I was visiting during orientation. \nAsnwer:"
