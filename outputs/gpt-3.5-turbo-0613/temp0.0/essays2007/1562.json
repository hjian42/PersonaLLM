No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:    Today is September 00, the day before our new monumental rememberence day ORGNAME September 00th. I sometimes wonder if tomorrow there will be another attack on the LOCNAME LOCNAME. It is weird to think that anything could happen tomorrow and we can't do anything about it. I still remember like it was yesterday watching the September 00th terrorist attack not knowing what will happen to the LOCNAME LOCNAME. I really hope that we can prevent anything from happening tomorrow.        Now that I am a freshman at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME things are beginging to change. For instance, my boyfriend and I are on a   break  , whatever that means. He doesn't like me only seeing him when it is convinient for me to hang out. He's a junior at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and has done the whole new college experience already. It is hard for him to not see me as much as this summer. I think it is that I really want to go out and meet new people. Getting to know the girls at my dorm in Kinsolving is really fun, and I like hanging out with them on the weekends. Of course this means going to parties with other boys there, and this doesn't make my boyfriend very happy. I can totally understand because I wouldnt want him to hang out with all girls at a party, but I have to do the whole college experience right?  Well anyway now that we are broken up, I realize how much I miss him and how much I don't want to end things. It's weird how when it's time to go to sleep or study that is all I can think about. He's so cute and perfect, I don't know what I am screwing up. It's hard trying to balance your time here now that I am in college. There is always something to do, and I love that, but I need to concentrate on studying and keeping myself on track. I guess in high school that courses could be made not as difficult, and deadlines were not so final, as long as you could persuade the teacher. College is a blast and I love my roomate. She went to high school with me until our junior year when she moved to LOCNAME LOCNAME. She still came down lots during the last two years of high school to visit her old friends every chance she could. So then she made the right choice and came to LOCNAME and we ended up rooming together. It's really fun because last night we decided we wanted to work out at the gym downstairs to take a break from studying and went to kinsolvings gym for an hour from 0 in the morning to 0 in the morning. I really need to go to the gym today also because I don't want to gain the freshman 00, I reallly don't want to go back home to LOCNAME LOCNAME looking like a heffer!  So anyway I think I might go run after I finish writing. Another hard thing about being off at school is that my best friend in the world is not here. She got in to the summer LOCNAME program but decided to go to ORGNAME instead. I miss her so much, we spent every second toghther this summer and are so close. OUr boyfriends are best friends so the four of us hung out all the time. Me and my boyfriend were responsible for hooking them up, so we could all hang out and it worked perfectly. Except now we're having problems and we're in the same town. My friend and her boyfriend are 0 hours away and doing great, funny how that works. One good thing about going to school here in austin is that it is so pretty. I love the hills and trees. OUtside my dorm room window is hills and churches. Yes, it is hot here but it doesnt have the humididty that we had back home. Another good thing about living here is that my older sister that is 00 goes to ORGNAME so is only like 00 minutes away from me. We have always been so close and I miss her lots. I went down on Laybor day with 0 of my friends to go float the river with her and her sorority sisters. It was really fun and I got to spend time with her. My mom is sad that I left for college, she wanted me to stay at home for the first year and go to a jr college. I really wanted to get out on my own and not have to stay at home and be left behind. All of my friends were leaving for school and I really didnt wnat to be the only one at home. I am one out of four kids at home. MY older sister is already off at ORGNAME, but then I have a 00 year old brother and a 00 year old sister. I don't think it is the same at home without me. My mom and I  are really close, and I talk to her almost everyday. She said it's very quiet without me at home, I guess I was always the busy one and needing to do stuff and rush around. Even though not being at home is very weird, I love college. The freedom you have is great. I know that I have to concentrate on my classes lots because I want to get into the communications school here at UT&gt; \nAsnwer:"
