I have been promised a vehicle by my father after i get my license, maybe things will get better. I always thought that college was lots of crazy teenagers doing what they do best, going to partys. Sixth street was fun last saturday, maybe i'll do that again. But i miss the summer where going out and having fun was no big deal. In LOCNAME drinking is part of the lifestyle, no matter what age you are. Every summer since I was 00 i would go out. And even living in LOCNAME LOCNAME last year, I would make it to LOCNAME LOCNAME on saturdays and they didn't care in the City. Here things are strict, really strict. Not only do i want to go back to LOCNAME, i also miss my family. I hated LOCNAME last year and couldn'twait to come here and now i'm leaving next friday to go visit my brothers in the Northeast. Its all a big mess. I really don't know what to think. Maybe when I pick up the ORGNAME next week my life will become a lot easier. Atleast I will have a car to get around in. The only good thing in my life right now in LOCNAME ids the fact that my roommate is one of my best friends from high school. We chill all the time and thats makes things easier. This is all I think about these days. LOCNAME LOCNAME, my family, my classes, and now my new car. That dps booklet for studying the texas road rules is long and tedious. I don't think i'll ever pass with those crazy questions. It really isn't that hard. I need to stop intimidating myself because its not that hard. Maybe when i get my car i can drive to caly where Guy lives and chill with him. Its been a year since i have seen that bastard. that would be cool since i love the ORGNAME A0. The interior is amazing and the car drives really nice. jUst the leather makes it comfortable to sit in and the stereo system is unbeleavable. The only thing in my way is that stupid driving license. When i get my actual picture i. d. and some insurance i'll be chillin. Maybe I could drive to miami during thanksgiving instead of caly. There i could visit PROPNAME and go to south beach everynight, where they also don't care if your under 00. The Beach was amazing last year. when we used to fly down from jersey into LOCNAME we used to have the time of our life. Things will get better soon, i hope. \nAsnwer:"
