Of course I'm used to   thinking and all. I guess. I am really sleep right now. I am always   sleepy. oh, and im so used to not doing the correct english thing.  like with caps and punctuation and all. i hope that doesnt take off   from grading. oh well. when i first signed in my native instinct was to   sign onto aim. i always do that. i love talking to my friends. i miss   them so much. im sure ill find some here that are great and i will   never want to let them go. but for now, the computer chat thing will   do. oh!! im so excited because one of my good friends that i met   probably one month before i came here is suppose to visit right   before thanksgiving holiday. he'll probably stay here for two nights   then come back to longview with me and my sister. hopefully. im   really excited about tonight. me and two of my friends from high   school are going to the concert thing at 0:00! i can't wait. i can't wait.  there are so many things i need to do. like set up an online account   for my bank, check status on my sister's book that i have to buy for   her, do the pretesting for psy class. i wonder what that is about. im   almost hesitant to sign up for experiments but i know it will be good   for me. haha. when i told my friend, his name is bryant, that i had to   do this writing assignment he told me that it was going to be just his   name over and over again. good thing its not. one of my favorite   things to do in longview is to go to book-a-million. i say i don't like it   to some people but i really do because i am surrounded by books.  there's so many of them. i love looking at pictures! the way the earth   comes together as a whole and works so well. it amazes me. its so   quiet around here. there's just the sound of typing and i think   someone is moving back in forth in his/her chair because there is   an occassional thud. oh well. i hope other assignments are as   interesting as this one. good thing i can delete my mess ups   because im making tons of them. i'm so used to having the   computer fix the caps or the right punctuations. yeah, the teachers   probably shouldnt tell kids that are learning in school that the   computer does that or theyll become lazy. like half of students. i   wish i knew some great jokes to tell. add some spice into this. uh,   assignment. well my sister did tell me one the other day but i can't   remember some of it. i hope everything is okay with judy. i know it   must be hard living in laredo with so much of nothing to do. haha,   she called last night when me and PROPNAME were watching PROPNAME   PROPNAME, such a great movie, and she wouldnt shut up. so me and   christina would joke around that she was being like mom. that was   good. i love being able to joke with my sisters. theyre so much fun.  well two of them. anyway, i keep looking at the finish button and i   read it over and over again. so its difficult to think when u read   FINISH constantly. my wrist are hurting. stupid edge of the table. they   should really see about fixing that. im sure it could cause some kind   of danger to computer uses in the far future. woops. i just kicked   something. hope it wasnt important. what to think? i not sure. i look   around and i see a scanner, a white, plain wall, many letters and   numbers, some monitors, a sun(picture of a sun that is) a pen. it   doesnt really smell much like anything around here. so whats going   on with the clear mouse? i don't understand it. i mean i do but whats   the point. its like a high quality ghetto mouse. it pretty much only has   one clicker, uh button. speaking of button. i was suppose to do   something with autumn. oh yeah, she said no because i was with   someone she doesnt    get along with.   oh well her loss. i wonder   what the people in lview are doing right now?blue, i think that is one   of my favorite colors. of course its always been. \nAsnwer:"
