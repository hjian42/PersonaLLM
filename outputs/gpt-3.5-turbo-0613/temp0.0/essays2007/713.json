Someone feel backwards in their chair and fell on my leg and scraped it. It stings a little, but it will be okay. I've been trying to do the pre-testing, but it won't let me on. I'll try to do it later. I like the internet because it is great that I can look things up on it. It's cool that I can look at notes from my classes. It's a good thing, but yet I still hate it because I do not have a computer and my roomates is not working for some reason. It is really annoying because I have to leave my room to get on the internet. It is also a pain because I can never get on when I want to. Like the pre-testing that I just tried to do, why can I never get on?  Oh well, I guess I will have to try later. My roomate and I are really getting along great. The only thing that is a problem is that she goes to bed at 0:00 at night. I can't go to sleep that early. Last night I had homework and she did not. I felt so bad because I had lights on and was making noises. I feel bad, but if I have homework I can't worry about her. so far, I really like ORGNAME. My mom wanted me to be an Aggie, but I decided I would much rather be a Longhorn. My mom thinks this school is to bg for me. She thinks I have the personality of an Aggie, because I am so shy. My mom even offered to pay for a sorrority so I would make friends. My mom can't even afford this school. I think I have made a lot of friends though. I am shy, but it's not like I am mute. I am afraid that my mom is going to be really lonely now that I am gone. She is the only one in the house and does not go out with her friends much. My sister lives close by, but is to busy. She is the total opposit of me, she is a social butterfly. She is 00, but acts 00. I heard that you can use your meal plan money at the Jester store, I wonder if it's true. If it is that would be really cool. I could really go for some pizza right now. I should go to the store and get some frozen pizzas. That would be good for Sunday night when the cafeteria is closed. I think the Kinsolving cafeteria is better than Jester's. They have a great selection and the pizza is really good there. There is one guy that works there that is really nice. He is allways smiling. I think it's cool that they have ice cream there. I love ice cream sandwiches. They are really good. It was hard to decide if I wanted to live in Jester or Kinsolving. The rooms are much nicer at LOCNAME than at Jester. I love the big window. Jester has a tiny window and the walls are pale. Jester on the other hand has a great location. It is close to everything and everyone lives there. You allways run into people you know and it's easy to get a bunch of friends together for lunch and dinner. I feel bad because I got my roomate sick, and 0 of my friends. oops!  Well I have three minutes left. I wanted to go home this weekend, but I can't. I did'nt go last week because of the football game and my sister came to visit. I can't go home this weekend because my ride's car's air-conditioning broke. I know noone will take me home next weekend because of the football game. I wonder if I'll ever get to go back home!  Both of my parents are coming for parent's weekend. I wonder if they get to sit with me at the football game. I wish I had a computer, it would be so much easier. Well my time is up and I really have to go to the bathroom, so I guess I will go now. Bye!   \nAsnwer:"
