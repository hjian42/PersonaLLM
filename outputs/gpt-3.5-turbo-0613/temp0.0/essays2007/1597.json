No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: MY eyes are closed right now and I'm wondering if I'm doing things correctly. I just talked to my best friend and she is very lonely. I wish I was there with her right now to talk everything out. Its funny how everything builds together to form one big heap of stuff that just explodes in your face. I am looking at the clock and wondering how long twenty minutes is. I want to get this done so can finish all my other assignments. I'm just very exhausted. I've been going nonstop this entire weekend. Just exactly how my fingers are going nonstop as I type words on this keyboard. I feel it in my neck and the back. I just want to go to sleep. . but I must go on if I'm going to finish all my assignments. I'm writingthis with no particular thought about anything. just basically got up and told myself. I think I'm going to do my psychology tonight.   and here I am. I'm tired but I don't want to sleep. I don't want my weekend to end. It's been a long eekend so far and its been pretty good. . If I don't sleep yet, maybe I could squeeze in a few more hours of a break. I've never done a stream of conciuosness writing before. Now I am wondering whether I'm doing this right. How can you write exactly what your thinking and feeling right now if you're feeling and thinking so many things. Right now. . its like a list in my head and it's prioritized, exept the other things keep comimg up like little post it note reminders. I'm also wondering if whoever is going to read this will think I'm insane after reading this. I rememberwe talk alot about the definition of insane in psychology. How can we truly define that word?  I think everyone has a little insanity in them. Just the way the mind works is so complex and the fact that everyone is different makes defining the term   insane   pretty difficult and complicated. It's not like there is a standard of being sane. Everybody is different so how do we know what is normal? I think its amazing how I wrote about absolutely nothing and then went on a rant about the meaning of insanity. or normalcy. I have another thought. My uncle is a diagnosed schizophrnic and so is one of my friends. Are they insane?  How could they be when being schizophrenic is normal to them?  I wonder sometimes if they have a concept of the   ideal normal    I don't think they do because Schizophrenia is their normal. Besides, who is to judge the   ideal normal?    I read a book by PROPNAME PROPNAME about a psychiatrist trying to help out his patient. Basically, it turned out that the psychiatrist himself was having his own problems. Who is he to judge his patient's sanity when he cannot even judge his own?  I guess this question is a double edged sword. Take from it what you will. I still have no idea. Anyway, Am I doing this correctly?  Oh here's another thought. . How do you know if I'm doing this correctly. it's MY stream of consciousness. Whoever is reading this has no idea if it's normal or insane for me to think these thoughts. For me I think it's normal. I write these kind of thoughts in a journal. I think the only reason why I'm sort of unsure is that I'm actually writing my thoughts for an assignment.  I am kind of enjoying this and it has somewhat put my tension and tiredness at ease. I'm actually kind of relaxed now. More sleepy. I think my 00 minutes is up. \nAsnwer:"
