No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am in PROPNAME's room right now using her internet-I hope she doesn't care. I get really frustrated with computes sometimes. I wish I understood them better. I only like Email. I like Email because I can talk to my friends in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I can't wait until I get to see them on my birthday. I hope they are just as excited as I am. PROPNAME is talking about her boyfriend. Everyone has a boyfriend here in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Alot of them are far away though. I guess that would be pretty hard to deal with. If I really liked someone far away I would be really sad here. LOCNAMEt night was really fun. I had a good time with my friends. Sixth street is always fun because there are such a variety of people there. One of these nights I am going to sing karyoke. Then maybe someone will discover me and I'll become famous. I think my friend PROPNAME will be famous someday. Je and PROPNAME and PROPNAME. They are so awesome--I can't wait to see them. I wonder what will happen with PROPNAME. I keep wondering about him. He has a girlfriend, but she is depressed and she brings him down. Maybe I'll learn more about her depression in this class. I just hope he's happy. PROPNAME is not happy with PROPNAME right now--she really lied to him and PROPNAME. They are trying to get revenge now. They wrote a letter about her and they are going to put it up in the restaurant where she works. It's pretty mean and I bet she'll be really embarrassed. I told PROPNAME that revenge is a scary thing because it can consume you. He said \"I know, but I've never been so furious in my life. \" I feel sorry for him because I know he really liked her. I warned him though. I knew the second I met her that she was up to no good. She came between two best friends and she didn't even care. I wonder how my friends at schools far away are doing. I think PROPNAME, at LOCNAME is doing really well. She has made two \"soul-mates\" from Las LOCNAME. I bet they are so crazy on the dance floor! I miss PROPNAME--especially dancing with her. She is so much fun. I guess I'll see her on OU weekend. Then I can tell her all about my trip to LOCNAME LOCNAME. PROPNAME will be home from LOCNAME, too. I can't wait to see her either. I hope she's been behaving herself. She breaks a lot of hearts. Her mom is really lonely by herself, I know she can't wait for PROPNAME to come home. I bet their phone bill is very expensive. I hope mine is not too bad. I've talked to PROPNAME and PROPNAME several times. I'm so glad I talked to PROPNAME though. We really confessed a lot to each other, It was good to get some of those things off of my chest. The situation is pretty good right now, I hope PROPNAME doesn't make the situation worse--if he is a real friend he will encourage PROPNAME like he said he would. I think my friend LOCNAME in LOCNAME is miserable. He has never really been his own person-- he relies too much on other people for his identity and now he knows no one a t school, He will really grow from this experience though. I should call him, but then again ===That phone bill! That (the save in $) is the good thing about Email. I can always send him regular mail, too. I like real mail. You can write your true feelings so much easier in a letter. That is why I like to write PROPNAME, \nAsnwer:"
