No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: A of the present I guess the most common feelings I have are nervousness, excitement, sad, and happy. I imagine that these emotions are all quite normal, especially for a first year student. I guess the first two I will talk about are the \"better\" of the bunch: happy and excitement. The main reason I am feel these would have to be that for the first time in my life I have \"true\" responsibilty, there is not a parent or teacher looking over my shoulder to make sure I finish all my work and get it in on time, it is up to me. Secondly, I am lookinf forward to the learning style of college. No longer will I be bambarded with quesitons asking about pointless dates and useless facts, I will be asked to explain the theories and ideas taught in class. The lack of this is what I disliked about grade-school. I guess, at least in my case, for eahc \"good\" feeling there is an oppisite, \"not-so-good\" emotion. Most of the people I have talked to that went off to college were the most nervous about the simple fact of being away from home, \"being on your own. \"  I have friends as close as 00 minutes from home feeling the same thingas those 0000 miles away. But, at least as far as I can tell, I am not that home sick. THe part about being away from home is the fact that most of my friends are going to school at home. Granted I have a few friends going off to colleges that aren't at home or isn't LOCNAME, but the most part if my friends are not in LOCNAME LOCNAME (home), then they are up here at LOCNAME, in fact my roommate has been a friend of mine since 0th grade. Even on top of the \"friends\" factor, the one that gets me the most is that my girlfriend is still at home. That would have to be the hardest part about coming to LOCNAME and the reason for the most nervousness and most about of sadness. Lucky for us though LOCNAME LOCNAME is not that far, coparatively speaking, so the amount of time we can spend together is greater than that of my friends who went to other states and have a boyfriend or girlfriend in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Although I am in the Longhorn Band, so that, at least for the fall, is eating up most of my time, but the time we do have together we enjoy a great deal, and both of our families support us so that helps considerably. So I guess all-in-all there are a lot of good emotions and feeling in me involving the change to \"college-life\", but nontheless there are still those \"not-so-good\" ones residing in me. \nAsnwer:"
