No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well, after reading the assignment I began to wonder how on earth I could track my thoughts and feelings in my mind. I mean, does the professor want some sort of biological explanation? Because I just got through about half of chapter 0 and the whole neural process. My dendrites are busy sending neurons through my axon every supermillisecond, right? Then again, I'm sure those thought processes do not include all my feelings because I do think a lot. For example, now I am debating whether I should go to dinner or not, but I can't leave in the middle of this assignment so I guess I'm going to wait about 00 more minutes. To track my mind. let's see, most of my thoughts come pretty random (at least they do to everyone around me when I think aloud) and. uh oh, my roommate is talking pretty loud to me, influencing my thought process. Not that I have an attention disorder, it was just a slight distraction  like the music that's playing in my dorm room right now. I wonder how long it would take to read about 000 students' thought processeswould that start to influence your own? For some reason, every time I start hanging around a new crowd of people every few years, I start thinking like them. Is that an aspect of societal/cultural influence, or does it happen to everyone? Thinking is something that occurs all the time. For example, even when I want to stop thinking and go to sleep at night, thoughts just keep wandering in. I guess it usually comes from my visual observations during the day and the little things spark new thoughts that occur either right then or much later in the day. Oh, I just remembered I should probably save this page before anything happens to it  but would that take up time in my writing process? Oh well, only a few more minutes left and then I save. I guess I'm kind of stumped as to what I should keep writing. I'm trying to explain how I think and how much I think, but the words are hard to come by. This happens a lot, though. Whenever I understand something in my head, it's hard to explain it by mouth. Some people have absolutely no problem changing these chemical messages into physical sounds, but I can totally blank on words that I say everyday sometimes. I think pretty fast, though, so maybe the time it takes to transfer from my head to my mouth is just slower? I guess since I'm writing this for a psychology class, psychological thoughts come to my head. I have a whole bunch of questions, and I usually make up my own answers to explain them  but I usually find out my explanations are incorrect. Right now I'm not feeling too well: I have a stomachache and my throat is all dry and scratchy. So, I start assessing why this could be  maybe it's the dirty air here that I've been breathing for a few weeks, maybe it's the water, or could it have come from my roommate who has a cold? But my stomach hurts, too. Is it the dorm food that is causing it? Is it the heat outside that is so unbearable? I wonder if it is from stomach acidity or stress? Nowadays I cannot tell if my bad health occurs from stress or from real factors. Will I ever find a cure to keep myself healthy at all times? Is there any way to be rid of stress? There are so many questions, but probably only one right answer. Who knows that answer? When will I find out? When will these 00 minutes be up? I wonder what other people are writing about. What do you think about through another person's eyes? I think I should stop asking questions and start explaining more about my thoughts and feelings  but aren't my questions an explanation in itself? I think its interesting that psychology covers biology, because wouldn't that mean there is something permanent about your personality in your brain? The question of nature vs. nurture has always interested me. I've always wondered if its both part nature and part nurture that influences the way we think. Does anyone think as much as me? \nAsnwer:"
