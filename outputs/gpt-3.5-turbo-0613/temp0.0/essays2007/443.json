No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I 'm doing this because for the first time all night my modem got out og dobve without the number being busy. I spent the whole night doing homework as well as most of the day. I'm really hungry right now which sucks because no pllace is open right now. I'm really happy I got bakc with my girlfriend last night. I went thrugh what I'd call semi depression during our breakup. I lost 00 lbs in 0 weeks and would eat maybe one snack cake per day. I was really forlorn. I cut all my facial hair, which took me 0 weeks to grow. I got  a short note from her last week saying she wanted to get bcak to gether. I called her talked and on Sunday night we went to PROPNAME. / It was one of the best concerts I've seen I n a long time. I think I might buy that CD. PROPNAME I'm starving. I  wish I could get a bite to eat. I have to be up a 0:00 tomorrow f or class, That really sucks that I havce to gfet up every morning at 0 while my roommate sleeps till noon. Its not faiR! I think I'jll call PROPNAME ukp tomorrow. I haven't talked to her since Sunday. I miss her. It's pretyy cold in my room right now. Last night it was freeszing. My roommate brought over  his friend and wastched Pollitically INcorrect while I was trying to study how rude. She was disgustingly overweight. She desperatley needs to go on a diet. I saw this really fat guy at the concert last night. Weighted at least 000lbs. I hope he didn't take off his shirt during the middle fo the show otherwise that'd be gross. I'm getting sick of  listening to LOCNAME LOCNAME and I 'm gettting really tired. Maybe I should skip my early class tomorrow. I was fine this mornign and around 0 I started becoming really drowsy. I don't understand how I can always be tired at 0-0 but then take 0 hours before I fall asleep. Well I'm going to bed. \nAsnwer:"
