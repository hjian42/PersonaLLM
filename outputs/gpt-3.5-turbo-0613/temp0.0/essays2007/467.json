I've met a lot of people. It means a lot to me. I am a very quiet, sort of shy person. I was afraid of coming to ORGNAME because I'm not the best at making friends. So far though, it hasn't been a problem. My big classes have been a little intimidating because of there size. I used to have classes about 00 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 00 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food. My brother brought it to LOCNAME. He and I will share it. I'm already starting to miss home-cooked meals. I think my 00 minutes are just about up. I probably fix a bite to eat, watch a little T. V. and go to sleep. \nAsnwer:"
