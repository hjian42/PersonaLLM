No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I\u2019m in the mood to write and so I decided to do this writing assignment. sometimes I get in this mood to write anything and everything that\u2019s on my mind. I guess it only happens when I\u2019m bothered by something. time and time again thought it always seems to be about people and my interactions with them and how they are so I don\u2019t know. how should I describe. I guess I was too sheltered to know how much people can hurt someone. why are people so selfish and care so much about their own well-being?  why does it hurt the good guy to be good. it seems the nicer you are, the more naive and innocent. the more you get hurt. you\u2019d think id get the hang of it by now. but I don\u2019t want to become like them. whoever\u2019s reading this. are you PROPNAMEian?  I am. or I believe in God and His Son PROPNAME Christ and I try to follow his ways. but it hurts so much because to win is to lose and yet I know I\u2019m doing something wrong because in psalms its says to be as harmless as doves and wise as serpents. I think I've got the harmless as doves thing down, but I\u2019m not very wise. I always get so hurt. I don\u2019t know what to say. my thoughts don\u2019t seem to be flowing and I cant seem to get what's on my mind out on this screen. I wish everyone were. how come I cant think. but I\u2019m supposed to write for 00 minutes so I guess ill continue. no, I\u2019m not totally disappointed with all people or anything if that\u2019s what it sounds like. in fact I love my first roommate. she was so good so unselfish. so caring and hardworking. then there's my second roommate. I gave so much to her. honestly. and literally. she never once cooked for me yet I always for her. she never once cleaned yet I never complained. I bought the groceries and cooked and she ate. I cared for her well being. I never said anything to hurt her. I don\u2019t even know how to describe. I really did care about her well being. as roommates, I thought of her as my sister in caring about her. and I tried to show her gods love. her mom came to visit for a month. I gave up my bed and moved into the living room  since we had a one bedroom. living with anyone\u2019s mother, anyone else would complain. the whole month she was there. I still cleaned. but she did cook. although I didn\u2019t eat at home that much. I tried to go home late and leave early because it wasn\u2019t very comfortable with someone else\u2019s mom at home. I tried my best. and I really thought my old roommate appreciated it. then the day before they moved out I noticed I was missing some silverware and a pair of shoes and since the mom was packing, I presumed she must have misplaced. so I left a note before I left for school to check for me - that I\u2019m not sure how many silverware because I lost some in moving before and so its not too many I\u2019m sure, but a few. when I came home that evening. there were my pair of shoes and a few silverware she took out all her silverware and started to make me look at every single thing saying, \"look! this is ours,\"  then another wrapped piece,  saying \"look,\"  and more and more. I was so shocked. I told her I didn\u2019t mean to accuse her of stealing, if that\u2019s what she had mistaken it, but  she said no, that\u2019s not it  well its been over 00 minutes now. and in the end she ended up misplacing more of my stuff and I wasn\u2019t going to bother asking about them. but it hurt me. not that she took the stuff, but to come out like that. after living together. I have a third roommate now (thank goodness the 0nd was only for the summer)and I hope everything goes well. I wrote about this because I saw my 0nd roommate today. and though we never fought I don\u2019t think were friends anymore. and every time I think of her,  I\u2019m hurt. \nAsnwer:"
