I HAVE A CALCULUS TEST THURSDAY AND I'M REALLY SCARED! IT is MY FIRST TEST AND ITS MY HARDEST CLASS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN THERE. THIS FRUSTRATES ME BECAUSE USUALLY I'M VERY GOOD AT MATH. I'M HOPEFULLY GOING TO GET TUTORED BEFORE THE TEST. WALKING AROUND CAMPUS IS VERY DIFFERENT TO ME . THERE IS ALL THESE PEOPLE SWARMING AROUND EVERYWHERE ,EACH ONE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM THE NEXT. IT SCARES ME BECAUSE I FEEL AS THOUGH I DON'T BELONG ANYWHERE. IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS VERY EASY TO BE NOTICED BECAUSE THE SCHOOL ONLY HAD ABOUT 0,000 PEOPLE IN IT. I WAS INVOLVED IN MANY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS HAD LOTS OF FRIENDS, BUT I AM THE ONLY ONE OUT OF MY GROUP OF FRIENDS TO BE HERE. IT STILL SEEMS VERY WEIRD TO ME. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ALL THIS PRESSURE TO SUCCEED HERE FROM MY PARENTS. ITS LIKE 'DON'T SCREW UP' IS CONSTANTLY GOING THROUGH MY HEAD. MY PARENTS SEEM TO BE WAITING FOR ME TO SCREW UP IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER . WELL, GOT TO GO DO MORE ASSIGNMENTS. ------    \nAsnwer:"
