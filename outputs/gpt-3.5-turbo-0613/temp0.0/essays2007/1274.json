Been putting it off for too many days now, got to take that class on procrastination from the learning center, might be useful. Only five seconds up, got 00 minutes+ more to go. wonder if hell read all this stuff. Hope not, or I'm definitely getting into one of his crazy guy experiments. Wonder if they have experiments to test if a guy is crazy or not. Who knows? I might even get paid for being a lunatic. God! Got so much to do in so little time, haven't touched my books, and already I have a quiz tomorrow. Hope I do well in it. Ahhh. two minutes up. maybe this thing wont last as long as I thought after all. Got to call up my friend to see if she'll have dinner with me. I hate eating alone. though most of the time I do eat alone. on second thoughts, I sort of don't mind eating alone at all. Its just that halfway through the meal when I see all the people talking to their friends and all that I find myself with no one to talk to. Oh well, who cares anyways. once I get settled here I'll definitely have someone to eat with everyday. so I better enjoy the solitude while it lasts. Hmmm. what do I wear for today's meeting. Hope she's there, man!, I got to shave too. One more thing I keep putting off. Only six minutes up, shit!, I better type a lil slower. Wanted to complete at least part of my assignment today but looks like its not going to happen, though I can still try to do it. have to come back from the meeting and do it. I miss my friends, used to have so much fun together. Three times a week to the computer course, that was fun. Miss those days, and miss those times. wonder if ill ever be able to be so happy again. Well, being sad about it doesn't help anyone, so forget it. Don't know where I got this sudden optimism from, but its doing wonders to my life. Not to mention making me more popular, and that had definitely helped my lonely little self to be more sociable. But more is still needed. Why I like to be alone I have no idea, but it just happens, and I don't mind it. My friends sense my depression my loneliness, but they don't know how to cure it, which as a matter of fact, neither do I. Yeah baby! We should definitely have more assignments like this. helps the workload by a lot, though if my finger keeps hurting like this I'm a goner. damn! That hurts! Maybe if I type a little slower. or not type at all. ouch! Got to give It some rest, but I cannot, because I have to do this assignment. If any person ever reads this thingy I apologize for my abbreviations, but I'm a regular chatter so I have to keep the words down. otherwise my finger gets the way it is rite now. Only a few more minutes left now and I'm free. Wonder how they grade people on this? Who gets an A and who doesn't?? Should I curse more to make it look real or should I just write what comes into my head. Well, what comes into my head would be better since this thingy is about. Who cares anyways, he wanted me to write what comes into my head, I did, so there. \nAsnwer:"
