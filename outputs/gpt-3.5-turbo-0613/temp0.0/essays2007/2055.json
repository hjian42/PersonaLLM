It's only been 00 seconds, I have a long way to go. My stupid brother keeps instant messaging me, I wish he would go away. There's a menu on my desk to a sandwich place we went to yesterday, that was pretty good. I wonder what we'll eat tonight. I'm tired of Jester Pizza. It's really not that good. Now it's only been a minute and 00 seconds. 00 seconds. Stupid kid keeps I'M-ing me. Good now he signed off. My roommate is reading the fourth PROPNAME PROPNAME book and I can hear her turning the pages. She is also drinking something and sipping really loudly, which is really getting annoying, but I don't know if I should say anything about it because that would probably be construed as rude and it's awfully early in the year to have her mad at me already. I've been chewing this gum for about an hour now and it's almost completely lost it's flavor. My sandal just fell off and I wonder where it went. My roommate stopped sipping whatever it was. I think it was soup. Who drinks soup out of a cup?  Aren't you supposed to use a spoon?  Maybe we're  out of spoons. That's no good. I'm going home this weekend so maybe I'll get my mom to buy us some new spoons. My phone is ringing and I'm pretty sure it's my ex-boyfriend PROPNAME but I'm not going to answer it. I'll probably tell him it's because I'm writing this, but I really just don't feel like talking to him right now. His new relationship is probably not going well and he probably wants to talk about it so we can get back together, but I don't really want to. I don't like being the plan B. I don't think it's very fair. The page scrolled down enough that I can't see how much time has passed. I'm thinking maybe like 0 minutes. Does this thing stop when it's 00 minutes?  Now my roommate is writing something. My foot kind of hurts where my shoe rubbed on the way to psychology class. Probably wasn't a smart choice of shoes. Oh well. I wonder when that water bottle is from. Yesterday I think. My printer has a blue button. I'm getting kind of bored of this and I don't really like to type. I hate e-mail and instant message and all that garbage. Why can't people just call you on the phone?  It's so much easier and then you hear the tone in their voice and know if they're being sarcastic or not. Sarcasm is completely lost in the electronic communication system thingy. Now I'm staring at the wall. It's a painted brick kind of wall, which is probably smart of whoever designed this place, but it sucks if you want to hang stuff up. We tacked a bunch of posters up everywhere. My best friend PROPNAME got a bunch of them for me. Too bad she is not here. We're going out to dinner tomorrow night, no the night after. Anyway, Friday night is when we're going out to dinner. I haven't seen her in a week, which I'm sure doesn't sound like a long time, but she used to be my neighbor when I lived at my parents house so I'm still kind of used to seeing her everyday. She is going to go to massage therapy school somewhere around here. I always forget the name of it, but it's supposed to be not very far away from campus. Now my hand is starting to hurt from typing all this crap. I think if I reread this, I'd probably think I was crazy. All of this is pretty random. I want the phone to ring because now I'm in the mood to talk to him. He is not very nice sometimes, but sometimes he really is. I think this is probably a bad situation. He wants us to be friends. He is a good friend, he is just not very good at being anything more than friends. He is not a very good people person I guess. My roommate is rolling around in her bed, it's kind of distracting. I have a pencil from the greensheet and I don't remember where I got or who could have possibly left it here. Where did it come from?  Do people actually read the greensheet?  I've never seen someone reading it. Kinda weird. My mom works for the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, but she doesn't write or take pictures or anything like that, she works in HR. Time must be almost up. Ha, it does tell me when this is over! \nAsnwer:"
