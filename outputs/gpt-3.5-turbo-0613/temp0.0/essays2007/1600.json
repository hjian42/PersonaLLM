No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      Right, here I am and I have no idea what I'm doing or supposed   to be doing. I'm sitting here in a computer lab because my parents   thought it would be wise NOT to bring a computer the first semester.    That was a ridiculous thought in my opinion. Of course they also   thought it would be wise not to go to LOCNAME to see PROPNAME this   summer only because I'd never driven out of state before. That   sucked. And I do feel bad because right after I got up here I went to   spend a couple of days with him. I had tons of fun and I really do   love him. I don't know what my parents problem with him is. I mean,   he's so much like my dad, it's almost scary. Maybe they'll warm up   to him before too long. We do plan on getting married, not soon of   course. Heck, it won't even before for like 0 years. I want to wait til   after I'm out of college because there's less financial worries. And   he's NOT rich at all. But anywho. I don't know. I still haven't told my   parents that I got a speeding ticket on the way home from LOCNAME.   How am I supposed to explain that when they don't even know I went   to LOCNAME?  I paid for the ticket myself, but it's still going to show up   on the insurance!  And thank goodness, I found out I'm not pregnant.   That would be another hard thing to explain. I mean, I love PROPNAME and   all, but getting pregnant the first time would have totally sucked!    Plus my dad would have killed us both!  PROPNAME, I'm so lazy. I still   need to do tons of things. I need to go get my work-study job and a   part-time job so I can have money. I still haven't done either. I don't   know why, it's not like I haven't had time. The only things I've done,   really, is hang out with my cousins every weekend and also go out   and do things with my roommate, LOCNAME. She's pretty cool. She's   nice, so that's a plus. And we really haven't had any problems. I   was a bit worried about that before I moved up here. I was worried   she might not be quite as nice or considerate as she really is. In   fact, we have a pretty cool arrangement. I can borrow most of her   stuff whenever I want and she can borrow most of mine any time. I   like that. Usually I don't get a long with some people. Or rather they   don't get a long with me. They say I'm too outspoken or something.   I never really know. Dang this room is freezing! I wish I had brought   a jacket up here with me. I have found that most of the buildings   here at LOCNAME are kept very cold and I'm not accustomed to that. In fact,   I hate it. Even PROPNAME and PROPNAME's house is warmer than this.   Speaking of which, I need to take them out to supper. They are   always letting me stay the weekend and taking me places. The only   thing I've done for them (other than spending their money) is babysit   PROPNAME and PROPNAME once. I want to take them somewhere nice to eat   or something. But I don't have a whole lot of money. I also need to   see if PROPNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME want to get together and do   something.  I had so much fun Saturday and PROPNAME's house; it was a   blast. I never knew croquet could be fun. Though, PROPNAME and PROPNAME   did also make it pretty violent. Just imagine contact croquet. Yeah, I   have a weird family.   I hope PROPNAME's doing okay. I know she said   she was fine but still. I mean, I know she probably still is pretty   upset. But I don't really know what to say to her, so I don't say   anything really. I like her, too; she seems really fun to be around and   nice (even if she doesn't think people see her that way). I just   realized, I need to call Windy. I haven't spoken to her since she left   for LOCNAME, and she's like one of my closest friends. I miss a lot of   my friends and family. But I really love it up here in LOCNAME. My   parents always said I'd get really homesick, but so far I haven't.   Maybe it's because I do have family up here. I don't know. Whatever   it is, it's working. Shoot! I just missed my Calculus discussion   group, I think!  I'm going to be so dead. But I really don't know where   it is either. I showed up Tuesday for it, but no one ever showed up. I   checked online and it is at 0:00-0:00 and in the room I waited at.   Maybe they had to do a room change for some reason. I've noticed   in some of my other classes that has happened for the discussion   meetings. I need to get my readings done for psych. , philosophy,   and bio. before I get too behind. I don't want to screw up my   chances at getting into the business school and if I don't keep my   gpa up, that's exactly what's going to happen. Oh, I just   remembered, it's only like 00 days until PROPNAME comes down to see   me. I miss him so much. But I hope he's okay driving that far. He   worries me sometimes. But I know he and I will have tons of fun   when he gets down here. I want to show him the capitol, the history   museum, 0th street, take him on a horse drawn carriage ride (that's   so romantic. . ). I don't know what all else there is to do, but we'll think   of something. Really all we have to do is get on campus and pick a   direction and start walking and we'll come to something! \nAsnwer:"
