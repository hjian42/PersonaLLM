I already typed for ten minutes and this thing loses everything I wrote!  GERRRRRRRR! Oh well. This isn't so bad. So. Let's seee. oh that's right. My eating disorder. Okay. I completely understand this freshmen 00 deal. because I, regretfully, am a victim. Yes, I, PROPNAME PROPNAME, cannot stop eating. So scary. I'm assuming that this is evidence of my subconscious depression that all freshmen are supposedly subjected to. Huh. Makes sense. I suppose. Hmmmm. wwwweeelll. I'm am also allergic to LOCNAME. I can't stop sneezing!  I think that perhaps my nose hasn't yet adapted itself to all this clean air as oppose to the humid smog of the one and only LOCNAME. Where are all these symptoms coming from?! So college isn't so bad. Definitely a lot more freedom. The first week wasn't so bad. Must've been all the excitment. But by the end of the second week. I was craving junk food and missing home. I'm better now by the way. After we went home for Labor Day Weekend and I am all stocked up on junk food. smiles. Dang it!  Stupid fly!  Shoo fly!  Don't bother me! Okay. So school is definitely killing me. Too much to read and my lack of study habits definitely needs polishing. But seriously though. I'm a true nerd. I even have the thick-rimmed glasses. :) Wow. Twelve minutes. Almost thirteen. How many pages is this double spaced on Word?  A page maybe?  Wow. It sure does take me a long time to write stuff. No wonder it took me forever to finish those english papaer!  FULL of nonsense. Hmmm. So glad I don't have english this year. Hey!  My twenty minutes went by pretty fast!  Wahoo!  Notice how I've painstakingly wrote all this gramatically correct?  Well, at least I got the caps and punctuations down. Go me. I can't wait until Christmas. My favorite season!  Big surprise!  Summer's fun but winter wins hands down!   So I wanted to work so I could make my own money instead of bumming off my parents all the time. But all this reading is too much!  I'm STILL behind. Its funny how I'm actually trying to study now when I wasn't much of a studier in high school. Huh. My thoughts are random. oh well times up! \nAsnwer:"
