    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: The first sensation I feel while beginning writing is the hard carpet of the dorms at dobie on my elbows because I'm lying on the ground with my laptop, but then again, at least the floors aren't wooden like the floors at the other dorms, so I really shouldn't be complaining. Also, my eyes are burning because I'm tired and want to go to sleep, I sleep a lot less in college because during the day there's constant noise and people and it's so much more fun to walk out in the hallway or go to the lobby and talk to people and see what's going on than to sit in my room and study, and since I don't study and do homework during the day I do it late at night when there are no distractions. If I stayed at Jester, I'd go to the library to get work done but I'm too lazy to walk from dobie to jester. This assignment is pretty easy and a whole lot better than sitting and doing my calculus homework which I have yet to do but I just looked at the clock on my laptop and it's only been 0 minutes since I've started and 00 seconds was when I got up to get a pillow to put under my elbows. My eyes are tearing now I don't know if tearing is a word, but they're getting watery from staring at this computer screen too long. I'm supposed to continue writing for 00 minutes straight and say what's on my mind and what I feel?? What if all I can think about is how I wish I was in bed, I think it's the music I'm listening to that's putting me to sleep. It's trance music, because that's what I have downloaded on my computer from ORGNAME, I hope they don't shut down napster. The courts are right about how the people who actually made the music (my roommate just called, I got all excited that my phone rang this late at night, I'm not a nerd, it's just that, I think it's this guy I know in okok back to napster) the people who make the music don't get their share and I understand and ORGNAME really should be shut down but I don't want it to because it's so nice to just type in the name of a song and there you have it, especially when they're old songs you haven't heard for a while. I love music, all kinds of music, it's the coolest feeling when a song brings back memories, or reminds you of people and events. It's 00:00 and I have to stop at 00:00, I hope I'm doing this assignment right because it's too fun,, it's kind of like a diary, maybe this could be our final??? Does the professor even read these essays that people write because I can't imagine reading 000 something essays about absolutely nothing even though those are the best kind, kind of like seinfeld a show about nothing that everybody loves. The music I'm listening to makes me think of illegal drugs, this is the kind of stuff people listen to when they're on ecstasy, it enhances the experience, I wonder why people need other things to have fun I understand it, but the world would be a better place if all the drugs were wiped off the face of the earth, but if that was going to happen, you might as well get rid of alcohol too, and nicotine and sugar and caffeine or anything that alters the mind, which is just ridiculous. Everything's here for a reason, I don't understand how people first invented and figured out stuff about drugs, I understand it when they grow out of the ground but stuff like pills, how were they invented did someone just put a lot of stuff together and try it and they found a combination that worked??? I'm scared for my younger sister, she's in the 0th grade, and there's so much going on now, with drugs and all, it's everywhere you go, and when she's my age, it will probably be so much worse, and so readily available, and curiosity is such a crazy thing, and no matter your willpower no matter what people always told you, you still want to try, and all the things we learn in elementary school about what to do and what not to do I think they bring in the whole forbidden fruit issue. I remember in 0th grade thinking \"How can something be so powerful that it can make you do things you never would, and make you steal from friends, and make you feel so good that you would do anything to get it. I would try it, just once. \" I can just imagine my little sister thinking like that. And you can't even shelter anyone anymore, because it's everywhere. You can't take her out of one school and put her in another, because it'll still be there, rich school or poor, minority or strictly white. It scares me to think about our generation in 00 years, because I can just see the damaged brains and the lung cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. Yuck I'm not even tired anymore because thinking about stuff like this gets me excited and ready to argue with someone. My twenty minutes are almost up and I could talk forever about what's on my mind, I always think about a lot of things which isn't really good because I can never fall asleep Ok that's 00, time for calculus  \nAsnwer:"
