No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:  I am leaving to see my sister at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and I will also see my high school friends this weekend. It feels strange going back to my home state. I feel like I have moved on in my life and in just these past four weeks I have matured into a completely different person. I feel that by going away to school I have learned lessons I would never have acquired by going to my state school. It smells like an old lady in my room because my roomate broke a parfume bottle three days ago and the smeel seems to have resided permanently in our carpet. The smell is so strong I can barely concentrate. People in my dorm slam their doors so loudly. It could scare a person in total relaxation. I am late to leave. My friend who is driving was suposed to be here about ten minutes ago. I guess this tardiness is a good thing becaus I need to write my paper. The problem with this paper is I can't type as fast as my brain can think. I hate Instant Messenger. You have it on and people automatically think you want to talk to them. And then after you fail to respond there is this constsnt message   Are you there. . Are you there. Well, I guess you don't want to talk to me.   This isn't the case at all. It is just that I have too many things going on in my life to sit and have small talk, such as,   Oh how is school?    I need to acquire better typing skills. That parfume smell is giving me a killing headache. I am glad I am leaving this weekend. Hopefully the smell will begin to difuse into the air. Our room is pretty clean for the first time since school has started. This is probably because my roomate is also gone so, she is not here to leave all her belongings strewn across the floor. Twenty minutes is along time to write. At first you don't think it is a long time, but when you are actually up against clock it seem like eterninty. I have alot to do in the coming weeks. In two weeks, I have my first exams in all my classes. On top of having study, I don't know what the tests will be like nor do I know how to do alot of the material we are covering in chemistry. But I cannot worry about this now or else I will submitt myself into ultimate stress. Yes, I am fligthing instead of fighting. I wonder if I will get to meet up with my parents this weekend. I thought at first when they left me at school that I would miss them uncontrollabley, but in relaity I didnt even cry. I don't know if this is becaus ei just havent allowed myself to cry for them or if I am just truely subconciously ready to mvoe on in my life. My back also hurts. I don't know why it hurts, but it does. I can't remember any activity I have participated in where my back would ahve been injured. Maybe it hurts from running. I am having a mental block. \nAsnwer:"
