Sleep sounds so good right now. I don't think I have enough energy to sit through another hour and half class, since this morning I sat through three of them in a row. Oh yeah I better remember to call PROPNAME so we can go study at the ORGNAME or FAC. I don't know if I want to study with a whole group of people but maybe I'll give it a try. This is so cool. Getting graded on a writing assignment that is of our thoughts and feelings. Reminds me of my summer English 0000 class that I took where we had to write journals everyday and as long as we did them and turned them in it was ok. It is sooo freaking hot outside. And I am so tired, mainly because of the heat. Hmmm. I wonder if PROPNAME has called. I feel so bad for her. Anyways, that is kind of depressing just thinking about it. I feel so stressed out. These first three weeks at ORGNAME has been busy. Not with work and stuff but with things like getting everything together and making sure that I have insurance, my checking account is correct and other important things. I miss the home food so much! But I'll live, it's not too bad over here. I haven't seen any guys here. Hahah! Well I have but I don't think I will end up dating any right now. My hands are getting so tired right now. I really feel like sleeping. I think after BA000 I will go to eat at PROPNAME and then head to the library or something. These labs and libraries on campus are so good. They have everything and you can use them whenever. PROPNAME should be coming next Thursday to that Career Day thing so hopefully I'll see her. I am so confused on what to go into, like majors and stuff. I'm thinking about MIS but marketing sounds so good right now. Like I'm more interested in that kind of stuff and things that I really would enjoy doing. I know it doesn't have a lot of money or anything, but that is not what is important really to me. I mean yeah I want to earn a good living but that's not my main goal in life to be rich more like be happy. So I don't know. Just a confused freshman I guess!. Maybe I'll find out pretty soon. Man this time is going by so slowly. I've only been writing for ten minutes. Just realized how many thoughts flow through my mind in such small amount of time. Man I hope I get a chance to do a project because I do not want to write a paper. That sounds too boring. Being a part of an experiment sounds so cool, never really done that before. Ok I wish I had my headphones, too like the girl next to me. I need to listen to some music. I wonder if we are all going to go out this Thursday night to sixth street. I kind of want to. I feel so bad for PROPNAME, cause of her roommate. She is kind of mean, actually she is very rude and catches an attitude with every little thing. Even if she does not know you, she'll be so rude. Dang girl. Hahah. Ok well I need to find where my BA000 class is so I will be going now. So much for this writing assignment! I think my twenty minutes are up. Well actually they are almost up. But it said at least. Oh well I guess I'll go anyway. \nAsnwer:"
