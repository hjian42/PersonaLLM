No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Right now my thoughts are geared toward wether or not I just submitted a blank page because I hit the tab button so I could write in paragraph form and then boom. the screen said you have submitted, thankyou. But anyways I hadn't even started. Right now I have no idea what I am supposed to be writing, the assignment seems to easy. Usually that means I'm doing something wrong. Right now my thoughts are concentrating on thinking of things to write. I feel like I'm in a sort of mellow mood, after all, there's not much excitng going on right know. I have calculus to do and I almost don't want to pick up the book because I know I won't be able to do some, andthen I may get a bad grade on the homework. That means that I will get a bad grade in the class unless I do perfect on the tests. Well, I wish I knew how to type, not that this assignment would go by any faster. Sensations? Well I'm sitting on a chair, I can feel it supporting me. I have this habit of biting my lips, so I can feel that to. Only bite the inside of your lips because then they don't look all messed up all the time. If someone reads this they are going to think strange things of me. I wonder if the box keeps going, yes it does. Wait. agh. a drink of water. More sensations!!  I felt the water coldly flow down my neck where I imagine it's being mixed with luch. which was a 0 inch sub from \"PO Boys?\"  At least it was relatively healthy, but it's more expensive than ORGNAME's. Oh man I hope that somebody doesn't call because I might have to write this over again. Or does the computer automatically kick you off the internt when you have been on for more than 00 minutes and not done anything, that would be bad. Does that mean that I would have to go back and write this all over again. Well, I can't wait to get this done because I get to relax for one damn second of the day. I've been up since 0 walking around carrying ahuge bag on my back. It makes me hunch over because if I stand up straight then I would fall over. I hope I don't have a bad back when I'm older. at least I'll be smart. Wow I've already been writing for 00 minutes, probably about the wrong stuff, but hey. Another sensation is my fingers hitting the keyboard. And I can see the keyboard. My cell phone just rang, I could hear that. Well, anyways, this whole 00 minute thing is leaving me with nothing else to think about. I wonder what other people wrote, actually I could care less. Their interpretation of the directions is no better than mine, but anyways. I really hope this actually submits. after all, it is the last minute. I'm glad PROPNAME reminded me. \nAsnwer:"
