No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      I just opened iTunes and chose to play PROPNAME PROPNAME's album called \"A Tribute to Jack PROPNAMEson\". The first song \"Right Off\" begins with a strong groove. this music first puts me into a pretty good mood. It motivates me to want to go to the gym or something and get a little exercise. Now the song is quieting down a little bit after a few bars and slowly building back up. PROPNAME PROPNAME is on guitar I believe, if not I'm pretty sure it's John PROPNAME. Now PROPNAME is playing. gosh. he's quite an impressive player. He's not showing off by playing a note every second. He takes it slow and builds up a good improvised melody.   . and they're always good too. I'd like to choose the songs to play before class starts sometime, to give people a chance to hear very respectable music that most kids nowdays seem to neglect upon hearing, because of a difference in style from the popular, well-advertised music of the 00's and 00's. or otherwise some people aren't even given the chance to be exposed to it. My roommate just came in the room. Speak of the devil, eh?  Take him for example. When I first met him and asked what he listened to, the first two things he said were \"ORGNAME and LOCNAME LOCNAME\". both of which I am not biased against or hold negative regard towards. Actually I find both bands to be quite interesting. I was exposed to PROPNAME and that very broad genre back around the days of middle school, and definately listened to it quite extensively. Side note:  it's getting hot and I'm turning on the fan. Could this music and the pressure to write as fast as I can be causing my body to heat up?  That could be quite interesting. Going back. I find it weird, well not weird but sad basically, that people like my roommate haven't heard and don't seem to be immediately open to new musical tastes. \"new\" meaning \"previously unknown\" as opposed to recently released. The song just phased into an ambient sound while PROPNAME is playing over it. The drums, bass, and guitar have dropped out. When the jam comes back in. and here it comes. oh yes. Well done. Movement (change) in music I have realized (as a good explanation) is what creates uniqueness and good sound. Change can include any part of sound. pitch, tempo, tambre, etc. Now it's just the Bass and PROPNAME. On this album is PROPNAME PROPNAME on drums, PROPNAME PROPNAME is on keyboards. I'm not sure who the bass player is off the top of my head. My roommate is playing video games behind me. I understand his addiction. I used to play games all the time throughout middle and high school. I went to an Arts high school for music and sadly games distracted me from studying music and my academics. obviously I did well enough to get into ORGNAME, but sadly not well enough for my own standards, although I did not realize it at the time. I quit playing games during my senior year in high school, picked up some other bad habits, but since moving to LOCNAME for school things have changed nicely, and although I'm not completely comfortable with the status of my lifes general direction yet, I guess I feel slightly better and more able to concentrate on the future. although the future is quite unexpected, otherwise I don't really know what I'm going to do. The song just dropped into a drum jam with a guitar riff running continuously over it. . and time's up. \nAsnwer:"
