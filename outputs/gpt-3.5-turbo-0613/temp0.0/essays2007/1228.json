No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Ever since this assignment was introduced in class, I've been trying to think about what to write (which totally defeats the purpose of the assignment). It's just that when I sit down at the computer to type something, I usually have a plan or goal in mind, whether it is to write a report about something or type an email to a friend. Never have I just had to sit at a computer and type whatever comes to my mind. I guess that makes me a bit boring in a way because I find it so hard to express myself at times. The other day when you were talking about obsessivecompulsive people, my roommate turned to me and said, \"That's you!\" I guess I had never really thought about that label applying to me. But once you started listing examples, I had an epiphany. I guess I am obsessivecompulsive in some ways. I like everything neat, clean, and orderly. I can't stand having a dirty living space. I mean, how can you sleep and use the bathroom in a dirty environment? For me, it's just not possible. Plus, I think it's important to be neat and clean because that's the first thing people see when they walk into your room, and how you maintain your room really tells a lot about your personality. I like to make good first impressions and the way I maintain my room is a way of achieving that. I think I get a lot of this from my mother because she's really picky about the way she likes to do things. I remember one time I started doing the dinner dishes for her while she was outside in the backyard and when she came in, she pretty much kicked me out of the kitchen because I wasn't washing the dishes \"the right way. \" Of course I can't really complain because I do a lot of that too. I understand that everyone has their own way of doing things, but I just like to do things my way because I see the logic in it. A lot of my friends think I'm a freak for being so neat, clean, and organized, but if I wasn't, I can't even imagine what my life would be like. Being clean and organized is what brings stability into my life. It is something that will never change. I guess I shouldn't say that because every time I say I will never do something, I end up doing it later on. For example, when I was younger, I told my older sister I would never wear lipstick or any other makeup and now if you look in my purse, you will see powder, two shades of lipstick, and lipliner. So I guess that's why I should never say never. I have so much to do today. I probably should have done it yesterday instead of sleeping and watching television all day. Of course I had fun doing crossword puzzles and playing Jeopardy online with my boyfriend. I've always loved playing intellectual games. It makes me feel great when I can answer a question or figure out a word on a puzzle because people are really smarter than they think. Sometimes you think you don't remember anything from a class you took sophomore or junior year in high school, but then it pops up in a Jeopardy question and you know the answer to it. It amazes me the things I remember from some of my classes in high school. And sometimes, that information came from classes that I thought were totally useless at that time. Now, I realize that there's no such thing as useless information (except for maybe Calculus when you're studying to be a Communications major). \nAsnwer:"
