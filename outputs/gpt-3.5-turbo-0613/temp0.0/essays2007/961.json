I will be glad to get this assignment out of the way, because I have so much stuff to do. My classes aren't too bad, but there's just lots of outside assignments to do. I feel like I'm always busy, especially with being in a sorority. I love the one I'm in, because the girls are all so genuine and sweet, but it really takes up a lot of my time. We have 0 meetings every week and then other activities. I don't feel like it's possible to do all of that, study, and make time for a social life. I have been having a lot of fun, though. My mom thinks I party too much. She doesn't really understand that I do work on school stuff, and I do know that classes are the real reason I am here in the first place. I know that I can't go out every night. I don't think I'll have too much of a problem, because I can balance everything and plan ahead if I know something big is going on over the weekend. My seminar class is kind of annoying. It's a stress-management course, and I picked it because it seemed like an easy one, and I really wanted a seminar. Everything's pretty much common sense. We have all these handouts and activities on managing time, organizing, and stuff like that. I do stress sometimes, and I always have a lot on my mind, but I don't let it bother me. I'm very organized, and I always find  a way to do everything that I need to and still make plenty of time for myself and fun stuff. My room mate does stress a lot though. She's always a little edgy and panicky. She kind of thinks about everything all at once and worries about it instead of getting something done and out of the way. She kind of looks at the negative side of things sometimes too. She's one of those \"the glass is half empty\" kind of people. It bothers me sometimes, because I like to be positive. I'd rather be getting things out of the way, then focusing on everything at once. I also don't think there's a point in worrying about something unless you have to. I'd rather just wait and see what happens. I really hope the guy comes to hook up the Ethernet in my room soon. I've had so many problems with my computer, and I hate having to come to the lab. It's just down the hall, but it would be nice to stay at my desk. It'd be more comfortable too, and convenient. My dad bought my computer when I moved in, but it had the wrong kind of Ethernet card installed. Now it has the right one- as long as PROPNAME comes to hook me up!  I hope there are no other problems, because then I won't know what to do. I'm so illiterate when it comes to computers, and I hate that because I don't understand how to fix things--or even how to tell what's wrong. I think it's pretty cool how we can just type all of this on the computer and not even have to turn in a paper. I was kind of surprised. I wonder if everything will be like that in the future; if all work will end up being done over the Internet and just mailed to teachers. It's definitely less of a hassle. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll get to see a lot of my family and some friends back in LOCNAME. I really want to see PROPNAME. He's such a great guy, and I think I  really hold back from getting too close to him. I guess it's because I knew I'd be moving, and I don't want to be attached to someone that I can't always see. It'll be nice to see him though. I might get to see one of my best friends too. She goes to ORGNAME, but she'll be home this weekend too. I think she's having tons of fun at college too. I'm definitely glad I came here. Sure it's big, but it would bother me if it wasn't. I'm having fun, and there's always something going on. I love that about big  cities. I can't imagine living in a small town and not having anywhere to go. I would get so bored. I guess it would be different if you grew up  there, though.     \nAsnwer:"
