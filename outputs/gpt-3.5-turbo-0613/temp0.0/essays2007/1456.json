Not to often do you get an assignment where you just write, write whatever you feel. What am feeling right about now. I mean, I just got back from my Economics class, with Mr. PROPNAME, or as he says the \"Hammer. \" It was a crazy experience with some few hundred people crammed into his class. Yesterday was an eye opening experience with one of my classes having 000 + people (yours, and then two of my teachers speak limited, and I do mean limited English. What a day, at good old ORGNAME of ORGNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME, I just thought of him, because I watched a DVD of his greatest hits. PROPNAME, to me is one of america's greatest comedians, because no matter what he was doing, he made the viewer laugh. truly an outstanding comedian, with a heart the size of LOCNAME. Unfortunately like many other great hollywood actors, comedians, and musicians, he too became inundated with drugs and alcohol. Like one of the characters he plays, PROPNAME PROPNAME, he played with life, and life came back to bite him, and instead of living in a Van down by the River, he is living in a casket down by the prairie. So much to do, and so little time. With all these clubs an activities and class schedule, college seems like one big whirlwind. With only moments here and there to catch your breath, and sit down to relax. Which organization should I join? So many options to accept, with so many good looking ones, but which ones to focus on. In high school, I did everything, and being in charge of a lot of them I was able to schedule each event around the other. But now, I am just another tadpole in the great lake. Phones are ringing, but no one is singing in my crazy packed dorm room. the twenty minutes is running to end. You would have thought I would type more in twenty minutes, but since this whole streaming typing is new to me, I guess I did a good job. Anyway, at least I did not copy a tv repair manual in this box and put it in. ;) Well, it's on to lunch then on to many other fun classes, some immunizations, and a bike ride. But before I go, I would just like to say that ORGNAME computers are the greatest computers in the world. And, no I am not some sort of Computer guru, I just think that ORGNAME computers are the easiest, coolest looking, and highest performing computers in the world. And, that my friend, is all I truly have to say. Thank you, and please, have a good day. \nAsnwer:"
