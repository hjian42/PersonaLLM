No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I needed to do something other than re-write re-writing a paper for   my freshman seminar. Yes, although the new IMac was the   #0   computer for college students,   it has already failed me twice. I   wrote the first copy of my paper yesterday, this morning I dragged   myself in after a long Saturday night to continue where I left off. The   screen was frozen, and my half-way written paper was beyond the   reachable distance between me and my computer screen. My words   are lost in the motherboard of this machine. And then it happened   again. I rewrote the paper, without a harsh-word. In fact, my second   copy was much more to my liking. It made more sense and fit   together. And then I wondered how long my paper was. I have this   tendancy to write in extra small font and single spacing so I'll   surprize myself at how much I've written when i allow myself the   viewing pleasure. When I hit the   paragraph   button, the   application   unexpectedly quit.  This time I allowed myself a splur of profanity   and allowed myself to make a few phone calls, since I'd had such   bad luck I might as well run the long-distance up as well. But since   no one wanted to talk to me, I turned back to the Imac. Not for my   damn paper on the film Matewan again. No, not yet. But for my psych   paper. With my luck this paper will also get lost in the matrix of the   unknown. Those unimaginable invisble power lines, where my   thoughts, words, and fonts flow to any other computer connected to   this wired (and now wireless) world. Now I'm all caught up in these   thoughts about the   deep unknown.  I've confused myself, my study   of psychology and science isn't deep enough for thoughts that   sometimes cross my mind. I should stick to the petty crush I have on   my RA and practicing for my dance tryout tonight. While psychology   is something that really does interest me, I'm not sure why. It's   classified as a science. The science of the mind, I've done my   readings. But I hate science. I hate math. In fact they're my worst   nightmare. Numbers and equations jumble up in my head and I   don't really care about the anatomy of ants or why the sun is so   bright. It just is. I can settle for that. Asking something any deeper is   frightening. No, it's not my   thing.  My thing? That would be visual   performance and art. Specifically, design. The word excites me.  Creation and design could be seen as similar. One could be a   science and one and art, or one in the same. But the science aspect   doesn't thrill me. It's the art. The color and the comfort. I love to   watch, to look, and to experience. Not to calculate. Maybe it's   shallow-that I won't to the shit work. But what's shit work to me is a   dream come true to another. My time runs out and my mind races   too fast to type my thoughts. If my writing is as confusing as it's   made me feel, I blame it on the techno music that my roommate is   blaring. Maybe the IMac doesn't like the music.   \nAsnwer:"
