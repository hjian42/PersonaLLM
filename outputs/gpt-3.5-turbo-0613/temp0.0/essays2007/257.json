I imagine what my classes will be like in thew morning and that I have to get up at 0:00 to be  ready on time for my Astronomy class. I think if I have any home work or stuff  that I have to have done for class. I then think of my next class which is Psychology. I think if I have any preparation I need to do for that class. I then think about what I'm gonna eat for breakfast and then for lunch. I then think that I need to go to the Microcenter  to get the software I need for my business classes. I am disrupted by one of my friends who call me on ORGNAME. I talk to him for a few minutes and then get back to writing. I then immediately receive a phone call  and I talk on the phone for about 0 min. Then I begin to worry how long I've been typing for and I try to remember when I started. I feel that it is time to go to bed so I decide to submit  the assignment. \nAsnwer:"
