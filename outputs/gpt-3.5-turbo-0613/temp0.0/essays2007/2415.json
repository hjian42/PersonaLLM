I wonder if there is a parade, that'd be cool I could go  listen to the band, I miss band band was fun if I don't make the dance team I'm  definately going to try  out for band, although my lips are so fat  I can't believe PROPNAME  said that about my lips sometimes I really wonder about that kid, he sure does tell  a lot of stories, I mean seriously he couldn't have gotten kicked out of new orleans  theyll take anyone over there, youd have to do a whole hell of a lot to get kicked  out of there I wonder how megans doing in alabama she found a new male friend I  wonder about her and jason if they are going to stay together they are one of  those couples that are going to stay together forever save a nuclear winter. I wish I  could be like that but at the same time I'm having fun I guess, I really miss griff, he  always made me smile even if it was something stupid, I need to go visit him at  atm I wonder how much different it is over there if it really is a bunch of cowboys  like I picture it I wonder if erin likes it since she's not into the whole spirit cowboy  thing, I think she would do so much better here with me! plus I mjust miss erin. she  was so cool I loved our no pants parties, they were fun bonding time. man 00 min  is longer than I thought suck town usa, I think this assignment is kind of cool to track  your htoughts for 00 min, it just proves further how random I am, I'm hungry, I think  I'm going to have a pb&j when I'm done, that's the stuff with strawberry jelly. strawberries whiten your teeth that is so cool I need to start using my crest white  strips again, I need to take a shower, man I forgot how far away kirby lane isthat  power walk made me all nappy. that's ok I'm sure ill get even nappier at the f-ball  game amin is so hot, man did I luck out on getting a counselor, nate was so cool  too! I'd totally date nate. that's the kind of guy I'm looking for, random funnyness  facial expressions everything someone that canjust make me laugh up a storm. OTherwhise ill get bored. I kind of want someone like griff though too. Although if I  dated griff I'd be really scared. Idon't know why, idon't htink he'd ever cheat on  anyone but he never wants a girlfriend. manhes good. really strong. he can bench  press me that's amazing I need to work out I don't want that nasty freshman 00. I  don't think ill get it I walk around campus like hardcore. its a big campus I like it  though I like getting lsot in it all its definately puts me in my place. which is nice. no  more trying to be something imnot. I hope I can find an organization to be in. the  wrangler darlins would be pretty awesome and pals would be pretty cool. I  wouldlove to get a really hot italian boy. man that would be cool. like hardcore  awesome. like paolo or davide or vincente that would be awesome this takes a  long time I'm having trouble trying to fill up the time I wonder when my roommate is  going to wake up its like 0:00 in the afternoon. PROPNAME take a nap I think I will. naps  are the greatest. I didn't used to like them but man are they awesome. especially  after reading philosophy, stupid philosophy its so boring but the lectures are cool. I  don't know I usually don't like to discuss abortion and stuff like that because your  not going to change anyones mind so what's the point in fighting because that's all  your doing is fighting I don't like to fight I think its stupid because your hurting other  people and not gaining anything from it so its useless hurt thatno one needs ihate  pain I hate to make other people sad I hate to be sad. good thing I like it here or I  might be misreable almost done 00  min and 00 seconds. sweet this has taken  forever I should be reading something or studying or something like that I want to  do well in colllege grade wise ireally want to make a 0. 0 at least my mom made a  0. 0 in really hard classes last semester now granted that's my mom and she isn't  doing as much socially as I am so she has more time to study, well actually she  workds all the time.
