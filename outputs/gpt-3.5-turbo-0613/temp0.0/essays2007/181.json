No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: here I am writing a required stream of consciousness essay. but the weird thing is that it just has to be done. it doesn't matter what I write about. right now I\u2019m listening to some music that my parents would consider useless noise. it upsets me that they think that the music from their generation is so perfect and magical and music from my generation is crap. and they think that all of the musicians I listen to are miserable drug addicted singers. their music had its fair share of messed up people. PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, the grateful dead. despite the fact that these people and other were pretty messed up, they are regarded as some of the gods of rock and roll. I just wish that they wouldn't assume that every band around now is like PROPNAME PROPNAME and nirvana. in fact, if my parents would give it a chance they might actually enjoy some of my music like PROPNAME PROPNAME band, blues traveler, and phish. but I don't want to get off on a rant here. my little window is right next to my computer and I have such a spectacular view. I get to look at the loading dock of the jester cafeteria and on occasion I get to wake up to delivery trucks dropping off some barely edible food at 0:00 am. one would think that with all of the thousands of students at LOCNAME and the hundreds living at jester center, they might have some food that tastes as good as week old liver and onions. I figured that I would be in excellent shape after a semester of living at jester because I walk everywhere, but the food at jester is so loading with fat that it doesn't matter how much you eat. if the university can afford to make millions of dollars of renovations and additions to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, then maybe the could get rid of the somewhat rancid smell in the halls and make the rooms a little warmer that 00 degrees. then they go and build a huge parking garage over a big parking lot. it seems like a good idea until you realize a couple things. about the first two levels are reserved for faculty. if you are lucky enough to get a space in the garage then you have to pay 000 dollars a semester. most of the people that are willing to spend that type of money for parking don't live in jester. they live at Dobie or university towers. of course, I don't have any personal feelings about that issue but I thought someone else should know about it. all in all though , university of LOCNAME is a great place because of a lot of things. beautiful campus, interesting people, a great sports program and , most importantly, absolutely gorgeous women. why would anyone want to go anywhere else especially in LOCNAME. a friend of mine got into duke but that was the only place that she would want to go if she didn't go to UT. Baylor: small campus, nothing to do, and you hang out with the same people from high school. LOCNAME Tech: What is in LOCNAME? and their sports program is a joke because the athletes aren\u2019t real students. Byron hanspard, their star running back had a 0. 00 gpa in his last semester. ORGNAME ORGNAME: do I even have to explain? well my 00 minutes is up and I have to go to class. Hook 'Em Horns!  \nAsnwer:"
