I was really tired so I guess I should have gone to bed earlier than I did, but I was having fun with my neighbors. After my 0:00 class, I had two more classes, but now I'm done for the day. I was so hungry when I got back at noon that I had to go eat right away in the cafeteria. Now I'm trying to do some of my homework because I have a lot to read. College is more demanding than high school. I never had to read a lot in high school, but now it seems that all of my classes require me to read 0 chapters a week. It's very hard to keep up with. And it's distracting in the dorm because something's always going on that you want to participate in. but when you have so much to do you have to set your priorities. My roommate just came back from class a few minutes ago. Her schedule is very different than mine. She went to the roof to sunbathe and then came back to the room. I really don't want to study. I'd rather watch Fear Factor that I taped last night. I was eating dinner at 0pm yesterday and therefore had to tape it instead of just watch it. I am going home this weekend to see my boyfriend. And then on Sunday I might be going to a waterpark with some of my new friends here. They are nice people. There are quite a few people here from my high school in LOCNAME, but not many people that I was friends with. One of my friends, PROPNAME, is here and actually lives in the same dorm as me. She lives on the 00 floor though. I live on the 00th. It's really hard to get an elevator from this high up in the building. Sometimes I have to wait almost 0 whole minutes for one. That is especially annoying when you are on your way to class. This morning I was almost late for my economics class because I went to breakfast with my neighbors. I wasn't really hungry but I had a yogurt and some orange juice. Then I felt kind of sick. I made it to economics, but just barely before the teacher started class. My economics class is all the way over in Jester, and I live in LOCNAME, so it's annoying to walk all that way. Especially at 0AM. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I don't start until noon though, which is really nice. On sunday I didnt wake up until 0:00pm. That is the longest I have ever slept in. Tuesday and Thursday I have 0AM classes, but that was because I had no choice. I went to the 0th orientation, so I didnt have much left to pick from. One of my neighbors is from LOCNAME like me. Except he's from LOCNAME, which is where my boyfriend's dad lives. I like it out there, because there are lots of trees. Maybe one day I will have a house there. I hope to have 0 kids when I grow up. at least 0. I am an only child and hate it, so I don't want my kids to have to be only children. Our power just went out in our dorm room, but only in one of the switches. It happened before and my roommate and I were in darkness for days, until someone came and switched the breaker. We know what to do now, so we flipped the breaker switch and the plug started working again. When I started this writing assignment I thought 00 minutes would be a short amount of time. but now it feels neverending. I'm glad I don't have any more classes today because i'm tired. Two of my neighbors are from the Greek island of Cypress. Their acents are really cool. One of them, PROPNAME, is celebrating his 00th b-day tomorrow, so we are all going to take him out to dinner. I don't know of any cool restaurants in LOCNAME, since I have only been here a couple of weeks. I'm sure we'll find a nice place though. The two Greek guys actually met on the plane ride over here from LOCNAME, and decided to be roommates. They are nice people. One of the book I bought for my Freshman Seminar class is not right, so i need to take it back. I'm glad they give us a good amount of time to return things, becaue it would be unfair if I had bought the book and just had to swallow the cost. Speaking of that, my neighbors and I went to the store the other day and I bought milk. When i got back to the room, i noticed that it didnt taste right. The expiration date isnt until September 00th, but for some reason the milk was bad. So i'm going to have to throw it away. I need to go to ORGNAME and get some groceries soon. I need to buy milk, gatorade, chips, etc. I sometimes get hungry at night in my room and the cafeteria is closed. Today in the cafeteria they don't have any vanilla ice cream. I'm disappointed because that is my favorite one they have. They also have strawberry which is disgusting, and chocolate which i havent had yet. Maybe it's good. I want to find a mall close to here so that i can go shopping. I don't know where many stores are. I did find a target however. That is my favorite store. The other day \nAsnwer:"
