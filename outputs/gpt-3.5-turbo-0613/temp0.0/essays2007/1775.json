No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      I just took that Pre-testing thing for psychology and it made me think a lot about how I view myself. It kind of put me in a bad mood because I realized how much I look down on myself. It was interesting to learn that much about myself just by taking a test. I don't know if that was one point of the test but it made me think a lot. I realized how scared I was at one point about how I am scared to speak up for myself. I wish I could but I am very worried that I will make a wrong point. Even right now I am scared to write the wrong thing even though there is no right or wrong thing to write. I love this classical music. For some reason it make me more at ease, I can never work without some kind of distraction or something else for my mind to think about. I wish I could talk to people that I don't know easier. I was so scared to walk into my class late today. I didn't know if my TA was going to get mad but she saw me and so I had to go in anyways. When I walk around this campus I feel like so small and worthless compared to everyone. I got lost this morning and I was to scared to ask for directions because I don't trust they will give me the right way. I know it makes no sense whatsoever. It is wierd how different music puts a person in different moods. First, I was listening to classical and I felt peaceful and then alternative came on and it made me feel more awake and then jazz came on and it was soothing. I think listening to a variety of music helps a person be in a mood that they feel like being in. I don't know if it is the music that puts the person in a mood or if it is the mood that picks the music that makes them pick the music they feel like listening too. My classes seem to be discussing sort of the same topic which seems to help in understanding each one more. I never realized my mind jumps from one thing to another so much. It is like before I finish one thought I already begin another. It is hard to concentrate when my roommate is on the phone with her mother right now because I am hearing like four things at once. I am not used to having to share my space and have someone around all the time. I guess I am just going to have to get used to it. I am very jittery right now and I don't know why. I think I need to learn how to relax because I am already getting stressed out and I don't think that is a good thing. It is wierd I start to look at the clock and it makes me start typing more even though I am not thinking more it makes me just start typing more since I know my time is almost up.  \nAsnwer:"
