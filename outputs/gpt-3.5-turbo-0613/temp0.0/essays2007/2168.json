I've been running around all day, then I got back to my friend's dorm and remembered that I had to do this writing assignment! Of course, stupid me. I didn't know the web address to get here. I had to call my roommate and have her look up the address on my computer. and now its almost 0pm! GREAT. Well, anyway, I'm so happy about last night. This really hot guy that I like invited me over last night to hang out at his apartment :) Exciting! It was a lot of fun. Now I can't stop thinking about him! I also can't stop thinking about PROPNAME. He still won't talk to me because of that stupid bitch he is dating. I HATE HER. She got between me and PROPNAME's relationship, firstly, and then our friendship as well. It's only been 0 minutes. I can't think right now. I'm so anxious for this weekend. Well, back to PROPNAME. every night for the past couple weeks, I've had dreams about him. They won't stop, it's getting annoying. Even last night I had a dream that we ran into each other in LOCNAME and were immediately friends again. That's what I wish would happen. He looked so cute in the dream. so I wake up thinking about the stupid asshole. BLOCNAME, at least this morning I woke up next to a hot guy :) :) That makes things a lot easier on me. the only way I know how to get over a guy is by dating a new one. I need distractions, GOOD distractions, to keep my mind off of PROPNAME. It sucks. I miss him so much but I know he probably doesn't give a shit about me. SO, I just want to feel. wanted. And if it's by this guy, PROPNAME, that would be PERFECT. He is awesome- cute, cool apartment, easy to get along with, funny, and he is even in the business school at ORGNAME! Pretty impressive. Of course, with my luck, I'm sure he has plenty of girls after him- so why would he choose to be with me. Hmmm well I can pray that he does! At least he wanted to be with me last night, that's a plus. I have to think about something else! It's driving me crazy. I need to go hang out with PROPNAME soon. she will make me talk about something besides guys! Yummm can't wait to order those delicious cookies from ORGNAME's Treats! 00 minutes. ALrighty then. I think I have about a million thoughts running through my head right now and I can't seem to distinguish any certain thought. Does that make sense? Ehh, oh well. School is a stressful place, especially now. What we do now creates what we can do for the rest of our lives! I don't want to fail. yet I'm actually scared that I might. I've never been scared of failing a class- ever. I never made below a B on my report card in high school. College is SO incredibly different! I really do love it here. Even though the classes are challenging, UT is awesome. I like having a big campus. it makes it feel like college. It's the way it should be. At least I have a little workout every day- walking to class and up & down all those stairs all the time. Its tiring! OK, 0 minutes left. JC is distracting me. I want to stop typing now! I'm sure whatever I just wrote down is somewhat interesting. I don't even remember what I said. What should I do tonight. hmmm everyone is going to the game tomorrow. My dumbass didn't get the sports package so I can't go :( How sad. \nAsnwer:"
