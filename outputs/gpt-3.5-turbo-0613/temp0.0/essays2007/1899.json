No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Wow I'm probably not doing this under the smartest of conditions seeing that I'm listening to some ORGNAME ORGNAME very loud as well as the LOCNAME LOCNAME / LOCNAME game in the background but what the hell why not. I was thinking about what the hell I was going to write about earlier and I guess it should be what it is -- a stream of consciousness. Ha. Well anyway I probably should not stop writing. It's funny how sometimes your mind works faster than the rest of your body (especially your hands) because sometimes I will think of something and begin typing it and then I will forget what in the hell I was thinking about until it's too late. The same thing even happens in conversations, and that sucks a big fat hairy one when I'm in the middle of talking with some one about school or music or the thing I was watching last night and then I will completely go blank because it takes me so long to get the words out of my mouth. Hmm it's very tempting to get lost in watching that clock in the upper portion of the screen. I keep seeing it tick away the seconds and it makes me want to look at it. I find all of this internet stuff veryu fascinating, especially since I am fairly proficient in it. Wow, this feels almost like an inner monologue because deep down in the back of my consciousness I know that I will be the only one reading it, so I get almost this pointless feeling to myself as to why in the world I am even putting forth any effort into doing such an assignment. Hmm that was the third time I have corrected my spelling. I wonder how many other people are as anal retentive as myself and are constantly correcting their spelling in this assignment. Typing is such a weird thing. I do it so much that I feel fairly proficient, but I was talking to pops last night and he said that he only types with two fingers. How does one get through life in any situation where he/she only types with two fingers. I just thought about what an ass I was last night. I was supposed to go to see PROPNAME PROPNAME with a fairly attractive, but fairly annoying and fairly commonly high girl a few floors up, but I felt really sick yesterday and the rain made me extremely lazy, so I told her in no uncertain terms that we probably wouldn't go to the concert even though that's all we had talked about the week before. I'm such a jackass / loser when it comes to relations with the ladies. I don't know what in the hell that last thing was, but oh well. Wow I wonder what a handful of other people I know here and at ORGNAME are doing at this exact second?  Hmm eight minutes and thirty seconds. The death knell tolls in the background. As does   Every Hungry Woman   off of the Allman Bros. ' first and self titles release. Wow, I will type anything to keep the flow going. The only other time I can think of stream of consciousness in my real world experience is a brief relation in   The Sixth Sense   when that little PROPNAME PROPNAME kid writes down every and any bad word imaginable and that terribly boring and lifeless novel I had to read in 0th grade called The Reivers. I can't think of the author right now, just because if I sat and thought I'd stop typing and that would defeat the whole purpose of this excercise. Hmm President PROPNAME is on TV right now. How sad it is that people criticize him constantly. What a load of hypocritical, cynical assholes. Wow, now I really feel like that little shit in the Sixth Sense as I constantly am using bad language. What a sad world I live in vocabularily (if that is even a word) if all I can do is cuss in a paper. I guess that's not all that I'm doing, but it is a lot of what I'm doing. Wow, that was a complete waste of a sentence. As was that one. And that one. Wow I could go on for hours like this. I don't think I have misspelled very many words so far. Wow, I deserve a cookie. What a sad statement. This paper is riddled with psychological buzz words and phrases. What a head-case am I. Ok, PROPNAME, enough. Speaking of Yoda, PROPNAME and Silent PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME was one funny, yet dissapointing movie. I don't know why I chose that one out of PROPNAME PROPNAME's entire repituare (that is most definately not spelled correctly), seeing as Mallrats, Chasing PROPNAME, and Clerks were fairly brilliant, and Dogma was exceptionally interesting although quite blasphemous, but I guess that's why I was so let down by J&SB Strike Back. It's funny how your mind jumps from one idea to another. I was just thinking about when I could go back home and see the folks. For some reason, I only get homesick and depressed when I am severly screwed up, which is possible, I guess, because I can see more clearly, I don't know. And by screwed up I don't mean on heroin or crack which some may need to believe. I'd never do that hard shit (I think the bad language is necessary there, eh?) Eh, what the hell am I, Canadian. Wait, no, canadian. I don't think they deserve a capital C. Well, they get a lot of flack for no reason. So I guess I can say Canadian. There, was that so hard. Yes. More inner monologue. Uggggh. 0. 0 minutes left. This is an exceptionally long feeling. I just got finished (before I started into this thing) reformatting and reinstalling Windows XP on my suitemate's laptop. I enjoy doing crap like that. Ever since I've been here it seems like there aren't very many computer proficient people like back in LOCNAME. Oh well. Time's almmost up. Yep, time she is a up. We'll delve into this more deeply next week (By the way, that was Something About PROPNAME. ). \nAsnwer:"
