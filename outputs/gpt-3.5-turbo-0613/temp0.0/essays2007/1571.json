In highschool i always knew what i wanted to do but here there are so many possibilities that i do not know anymore. the water is running form somewhere i am not sure but it is annoying. i live at dobie on the 00rd floor and we had a fire drill tonight so ihad to run down 00 flights of stairs that was fun. my roomate is really neat we met at summer school and get along great. i am waiting for clay to call me he is supposed to be out of his meeting sometime . . but i am not sure when that is. i also need to do some pre-cal homework and the read more economics but i think that i can do that after class tomorrow and i willb e fine. . i am not the best typist in the world i use to be able to type but hten i go this new laptop and it is funny the keys are closer together and my nails hit them queerly. I just got my nails done the other day i needed a manicure i have been stressed out lately and hands are something that i notice first on people so i like for mine to be pretty. . and it puts me in a bterr mood. I am thinking that i am typing and i have no idea who is reading this and i am sure they do not care what i am talking about but oh well that is ok too. . I like going ot UT it is really big and full of people i feel like i might get lost in the crowds but other than that i think i will have fun . . as long as i continue to meet people. I am not the best friend maker. . i have had the same set of friends since i was in the 0th grade and we have all just gotten along well. Here it is different but should be exciting. My rhetoric teacher does not speak english and i can not understand a word she says. . i haev a paper due on the 00th which is friday te 00th and i think those are cool. Sherene just signed in on the computer. . that is my bestfriend i wonder what she is doing i bet she just got done with her duitemates or something. I hope she is adjusting well to college she is the only one who went to LOCNAME and she seems to like it so far. I wish that we would have gone to the same school but i know that we wouldhave never branched out if we did. there is no music on i want to turn some on but i have to write and my roomates are studying. someone just IMed me buti cna not respond i am typing. my thoughts are sparing i really and not thinking much at all. . tomorrow i have to go to y dance class at 0:00 then i think i will work out then come back eat lunch take a shower hten go to eco then who knows. . take a nap probably i love naps they are the best things ever. It has been almost 00 min now and i am getting bored with this but i am still going. I called my mom today and she didn't want to talk to me. . well i think she did but she was busy she does not like her job. . well the people she works with atleast. ithink she should get a new one but she won't look myabe i shouldlook for her nad find her one as a suprise. i need to email a&m to see what scholarsips they give out to unmarried teenage mothers. . not that i am that . . but my sister is and she wants to go to school there and i heard this rumor that they give out very good scholarships. My mom wanted me to check on that for her. . A lot of my friends are going to ORGNAME i don't know why they would evr want to do that. but hey it is thier life. my roomate just walked in and is playing with her computer. . it is making some noise but now it stoped. . i haev nothing to think about. I need to work out but it is too late and i am lazy. . oh well Homecoming is in like 00 days and i have to go home. . it is a tradition for the old officers to go back and sit with the drillt eam and watch and stuff but i need to lose weight so that they are not like oh my god what happened to her. . and i need to go shoping for an outfit to wear. . i am not sure what i want though. . maybe i want a skirt or something austinish or maybe clasical would be better. . who knows who cares really . . they are all still in highschool and if they did not like me then they are not goig to like me now and i do nto really care either way.
