    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I feel a little behind in everything I am doing for school. I have a hard time reading for long periods of time. My eyes cannot stay focused for very long and words become blurry. It's a constant struggle to understand each sentence. I'm not sure if I have always had this problem. I can read novels fairly easy. I really hate being in class with a lot of people. I don't like to interact with them. They seem to be very clueless over the important parts of the material covered in each session. I'm tired of stupid Internet questions that waste class time. If I had a computer question, I wouldn't stop class to ask it and make myself look stupid like most computer illiterate students. Students in psychology seem to pretend that they are interested in what is taught, but they really are not fully in to the subject. There are so many students who claim they are psychology majors, when in fact, after they take Psy000, they'll change their minds to something over and over until they slide into the working class. I cannot understand many of my peers. Their conversations are pointless and insignificant to their life as a whole. They spend so much time conversing over issues that they usually don't care about. I dislike the general public in the college atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoy the professors, but I can't get any intelligent feedback from my peers. I realize I'm not perfect, by any means, but at least I attempt to improve my intellectual state, somewhat. There are way too many sheltered students. I assume that professors have a hard time, especially with freshman, in trying to relate cultural differences. It must be extremely difficult to maintain the patience required to teach any level of pupils. Students forget that they are the ones paying for the class and the professor. Even in college, they still act as thought they're being forced to attend each session and assigned a certain professor. Most of the time, students fail to research their professors before they sign up for their class. I suppose it takes all kinds to make a world. \nAsnwer:"
