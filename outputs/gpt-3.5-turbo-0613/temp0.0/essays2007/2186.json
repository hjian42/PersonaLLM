I have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 00:00 because I have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. I have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. Also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. I am also scared that  by tomorrow I will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. I have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so I guess I should go. I kind of miss my room at home. It is hard to have to share a room with someone. This is the first time I have never had a room all to myself. Sometimes I wish the room was just mine but I am ok with it because I know it is good to have a room mate. PROPNAME is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. I really need to work out but I cannot because of this sinus infection that I have. When I run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. How that works, I don't know. I was thinking about it. How can sinus fluid hurt your face. I could ask the doctor, but I am too lazy to listen to the answer so I won't. Hmmm. whatever is on my mind. I really have a lot of studying to do. It is 00:00 in the morning and I woke up just to study. Getting this done though makes me feel as if I have gotten something accomplished. I like that feeling of accomplishment. Everytime you do something you get a check. Chapter 0: Check, Chapter 0: Check. The check feels really good. I don't know why it feels so good but it does. I am kind of concerned right now about the time. This clock on the computer is really off but I am using it anyway. I just have to time 00 minutes right? I have ten minutes left. I have rally never known how to spell the word minute. I don't even know if that is right. For all I know that could be the for minute(as in small) I even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless I was talking about music, it wasn't. So for now I just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though I just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling I typed it wrong. I am actually a good speller, I promise. I just get confused sometimes. This it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. I guess I will type about something interesting. Hmmmm lets see. I really want PROPNAME(sp) to do that recording test on me. The one where is records every five minutes. (See there that word is ageing) I really would like to know what is going on in my life. So far this is what I think is going on but I am not really sure. I am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. I need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. I am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: I stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. I don't have a football ticket. I think I might go to LOCNAME LOCNAME instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. He is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. I thought I might cheer him up. It makes my grandma up set so I though she could use some cheering up too. And this is why I need to take the Recording test. Because I hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that I do not realize. It has been 00 minutes- good bye. \nAsnwer:"
