Somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner's \"A Light in August\"  we read that nnovel in my senior AP English class and although iit was a touch on the  boring side at the beginning, it proved to be quite an interesting story. Well I'm in my  dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator  that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times. I. E: when I'm trying to take a  nap. Our refrigerator is in the closet. It was in the middle of the room, but my roommate  moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead. My  roommate's name is PROPNAME and he's been out of town this weekend as far as I can tell. He  kind of just didn't come home on friday night so my assumption is that he's visiting his  family. I think he's from LOCNAME, but I could be mistaken. PROPNAME is dating a girl named  PROPNAME and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne. Because it smells like crap!  Which sucks, because it's a really expensive Dolce and Gabbana or however you spell it. It  really is terrible because it's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to  everything in our room. Especially all my clothes, which has made me start to smell like  him. Oh I hate it. I always want to say something, but it would be weird saying to him that  his designer cologne smells like ass and that I could make the scent personally with some  onions and curry. God! I've been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of  weeks, but haven't exactly found one. Well I found one on guadalupe, but haven't looked at  what the times are for mass or whatever. My dad is really pushing me to start going to  church because in the last few years he's become somewhat of a Jesus freak. He's not bad,  but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things. For  instance, I joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it; refuses to help pay for it  simply because he doesn't like fraternities. But he doesn't exactly say why. And since he's  never been in one I don't see how he can make such a judgement. Oh well, my dad and I  went camping this weekend. We like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a  place called PROPNAME's Ranch. So we found a new camp site called LOCNAME LOCNAME and it  was really nice. So we camped there with a fire and the whole 0 yards or whatever. But  me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that I took  the plastic rain cover off the tent and went and laid near where the fire was on the  ground. It was pretty bad, but I made it through. Only got about 0 and a half hours of  sleep though. ughh. Oh well, when we all woke up we went and got breakfast and headed  to PROPNAME's and it was closed! so all that work for nothing. But we didn't give up hope and  went to this other place they call the greenbelt and got set up to climb there, but only got  to do one route because it started to rain. So after that our hopes were pretty much shot  so my dad just brought me back to my dorm this morning around noon and I took a nap  that I just woke up from about 00 minutes ago. So my weekend was pretty lackluster but  it'll be ok because I know next weekend will be fun enough to make up for this one. Oh  well. My mom just called me a second ago and I was like, \"can I call you right back? I'm  doing a project\" and she's so understanding and just said \"bye\" really quick so after I'm  done with this thingy I'll call her back. I've actually been keeping in touch with my mom  pretty well since I moved here which has been nicer than I imagined it would. I expected it  to be annoying talking to her too much but I was mistaken. I've also been talking to my  sister via email which has been fun. She's so funny and always has something to say, but  whenever I call home and she answers it's like we have nothing to say and I just ask for  mom. kind of funny, but it's cool. I know it's weird, but the thing I miss the most about  home is my dog. I have a full-blooded springer spaniel named PROPNAME and she's such an  awesome dog. I miss her so much, but I'm hoping that if I live in a frat house next year I  can bring her along so we don't have to be apart anymore. Oh well, I guess we'll see \nAsnwer:"
