The air conditioner is blowing on me, giving me goose bumps. My stomach has felt bad all day, I took Pepto Bismol an hour ago but it hasn't seemed to help. I'm tired, and it's only 00:00. This house is always so messy, I wish PROPNAME would help me keep it clean. I'm going to start doing better. The picture of Deban on my desk is so bad, she would die if she saw it. What am I going to wear tomorrow?  I don't want to have to wake up early. I have to wake up at 0, I guess that isn't that early. I had so much fun at my family reunion. I miss my family even though I just saw them 0 days ago. Some woman on the TV was trying to kill her kid, PROPNAME PROPNAME wanted to kill her daughter?  The news is so horrible. It's rediculous what goes on in our country every day. I think more people should be executed. The government spends way too much money on keeping people in jail and on death row. If someone is found guilty for intentjionally killing someone or trying to should be executed then and there, saving lots of people time and money, and making a point to the general public. I can't wait until Christmas. I already know what I'm going to get PROPNAME and my mom, and my dad. We're going to get my dad a 00 K modem. He's wanted one for a long time. What a boring gift, he is such a boring guy. OH well. I don't want to type for 00 more minutes. I think this assignment is stupid. I don't see the point. Or maybe there is  a point, but I'm not helping because I'm doing it wrong. What does it matter, is anyone really going to read this?  I feel sorry for the person who has to read all of these things. Oh good, I didn't want PROPNAME to come over and read this, he left the living room. Our apartment is pretty smalll but I resally like living in austin. Finally, he's going to take out the trash. Only one little responsiblity and he hardly can take care of it. Oh that made a lot of sense. some guy on the news is getting 00 years for molesting a child. What makes me sick is all the women killing their babies. I think pretty much all of those women should be executed, its rediculous how little our society cares about little babies. They are people too they shouldn't be murdered because of their stupid mothers. I think that if those mothers wouoold be punished more severely, there would be less instances of mothers killing babies. I hate democrats. I hate PROPNAME PROPNAME. I will be so glad when he is no longer our president. I hope PROPNAME runs next year, I know he'll win and our country will be in much better hands. 0 more minutes of typing stuff noone will ever read. tomorrow is wednesday, that means church and 0:00. So should I go to the trig review class or should I go to church?  I think I'll end up leaving early from class so I can make it to church. I need to get my priorities straight. It's hard to make yourself go when you know you don't have to, and no one wouold ever know. I want to save peolpe from going to Hell, like where mosdt of the world is headed. Now I'm glad no one will read this because it soulnds like I\"m some crazy conservative person. Narrow is the road to salvation, wide the road to destruction. The bible says loud and clear that more people will go to Hell than Heaven. \nAsnwer:"
