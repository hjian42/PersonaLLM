No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: So this is the third time that I have tried to do this for some reason my computer is having some problems this morning. Explorer crashed and so I had to reboot my machine which can take a while. It's amazing how slow PC's get after you install Anti-Virus software. In the process of it rebooting I went and made a cup of coffee. Bavarian Hazlenut form ORGNAME, delicious. So I was thinking about this assignment and how it was similar to an assignment I took in a Humanities class a while back. They asked us to spend 00 minutes alone somewhere, anywhere just thinking about anything and making notes. I spent it in the campus parking lot, a wide open space, fairly peaceful, trees swaying in the summer breeze and began making notes, not really sure of the purpose. After the 00 minutes was up I realized that I was much more in tune with all of my senses than at the start. Normally I would walk around just using the sense that were needed, sight, hearing and focused on coordination, driving, etc. During the 00 minute period in the parking lot I became aware much more of my sense of touch, the feel of the paper I was writing on, the smell of my surroundings, the movement of the trees as they swayed in the breeze, I've mentioned that twice now, what does that mean?  I just finished my first cup of coffee. My apologies about my spelling. I have a tendency to just type first and ask questions about my spelling later. I don't know how this app handles me jumping back to correct spelling. I hope I'm not confusing it. Probably not. A thought of sunny beaches just jumped into my head for no reason. South Padre on a breezy summer evening. Again this breeze thing, what's with that?  In fact I'm thinking about the breeze that may be outside right now. I just went out to feed the cats and it was cool and a little breeze was in the air. Perhaps I need to go outside when I'm done here and soak it up. It's like a vitamin that the body is lacking, eventually you crave something that subconsciously you know gives you that vitamin. For some reason , perhaps I didn't get out enough at the weekend, I need to feel the breeze.  ORGNAME ORGNAME,  I have a coupon to ORGNAME ORGNAME sitting in front of me. I like that place and apparently if I go there this week and spend $00 or more then I can get $00 off rib-eye steaks. The fan spins slowly overhead, a gentle clicking, a low hum,  the sound of my typing and then, silence. Why are keyboards so awkward. Isn't there a better way to do this. Surely a Psychologist somewhere has studied this and come up with something, more ergonomic. I'm thinking about my brother. I just spent 0. 0 months in the ORGNAME ORGNAME during the Summer working for him, selling. They are a web services company. He is the owner and a good guy. He is the glue that keeps many things together. He has 0 kids who are all precious. One has a spine problem and can't walk. That unfortunately is the extent of my knowledge. English people are strange in that they make it hard to communicate simple things to each other. They do things that they think are right but in fact are completely wrong. I got attacked while I was in the PROPNAME PROPNAME. In the street at 0:00 in the morning on Friday the 00th. I was on my way to work and got attacked. The Police there are awful. They just don't care. They are nowhere to be found. In the most obvious situations where you would think they would be they hide and when you least need them they are there to hassle you. I have not been hassled but they are that kind of personality. Just my impression. Power hungry wimps. No idea for the big picture, just CYA and demonstrate what little power you have. Why can't they quantities the biggest problems and formulate a response and go about resolving it. Did you know that LOCNAME has now clearly taken over the spot of the capitol for drunks in LOCNAME. The British government will be introducing laws next year to combat the problem. Why do they not have a public intoxication law now????  You can be drunk in the street hassling old ladies and get away with it while the police stand by and chat to one another!!!!  Well my time is almost up in fact a notice just came up. Time to go. Hope this has not been boring. Have a great day. Go LOCNAME!!! \nAsnwer:"
