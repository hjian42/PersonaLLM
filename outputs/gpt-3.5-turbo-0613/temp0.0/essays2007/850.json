No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Right now as I am witing this paper I am thinking about wether I should go to class today or if I would be okay if I did not go at all. If I do notgo it will be okay becasue I can read in my book and then just go to si and still do fine, but I do have a mid term on the 00th in my psychology class which could pose a problem that will be in seven days on next monday. I have to start studyning and reading or I will not get the gpa I need to transfer into thw business schopol. I do not even know why I want into that shcool so badly I thinkthat it is mainlky because of the repect that schoo,l demands. where as the liberal arts schol is more of the blow off lazy person school for peopl who want to be Managers of local ORGNAME. Ohh and I have some bills to pay today. I wish I was rich and could aford all the things I wanted without material wants I believe my life woud be a lot easier than it is right now. IF I had all the money than I would have no stress. Without stress I can relax and enjoy life. I know that people sa that money is the root of all evil and money will never make you haooy, and I believe in this 000%. but I do believe that if I were to have enough money to live comfortably and get anything with in reason that I would be beter off. I am talking with my girlfriend of almost 00 months right now and she is distracting me from my work by talking to me and arguing with me about different things. We have an over all good relationship nd very rarely argue. this is mainly because she has a very low self esteem and will not stand up for herself inan argument. I onn the other hand am very cnfrontational and when something is not good with kme I will let the people it involves know. Where she will not. I like her a lot and so do al my friends and parents, but sometimes I have considered especially after three weeks of coleg what it would be like to be single again and able to date many people. I somewhat miss it, but at the same time do not I think for now I will stay with my girlfriend. I just thought I ave to call my stors manager and report one of my fellow employees. He is stealing product from the store, and there is a big reward if someone reports him and he is found guilty. I think he will be found guilty, but I am wondering wether or not I made the right decision in turnign himin, but thne again I could get up to $0000. So since I am there to make mone not friends I think I am making he right decision. Wle finally my twenty minutes is oming to a close this is a hard assignent it is hard to think and write in conjunction. I am not used to this since I hae never kept a diary or anything ike that, I guess for those that have kept a diary this assignment is a simple one. well there it is all done. Bye \nAsnwer:"
