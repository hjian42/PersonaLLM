No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: That is what I feel I should do first, is give you my social security number to make sure I get the grade for this assignment. Good thing this assignment is based on completion because at the rate I type I do not type much in the time span ORGNAME twenty minutes. I guess since just in my class alone there is on estimate 000 students in there all of which will be turning this assignment in this week sometime, it makes it practically impossible for you to read through everyone's writing even with the help of your teacher's assistance. You never really think about how many thinks and thoughts run through your mind in just the coarse of a few minutes. Your class schedule for that day, what assignments you need to get done, people you want to hangout with, and even the decision of if you want to do any of these things will cross your mind on a normal day of class with out you really even notice yourself thinking about these things. ORGNAME has been on my mind for the last few days especially. I have been trying to decide if I wish to play of the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME teams. While on this Thursday I have a tryout for the ORGNAME of ORGNAME Baseball ORGNAME. I guess I figure that I will see how the tryouts go for me on Thursday and make my decision. I really want to play for the UT baseball team but if that does not workout then the ORGNAME ORGNAME team will be the next best thing. I honestly have a good feeling about my talent and the way the coach sounded on having a good opportunity on making the team as a walkon. Right now just thinking about it gives me a adrenaline rush. Just think if I made it how exciting every game would be. It is a trill just watching a football game just think about it if all those people are in the stands and your apart of the team! Well my time is up so have a nice day. PROPNAME PROPNAME \nAsnwer:"
