No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I\u2019m feeling a little stress coming on now, because I\u2019m think about everything  I have to do, but have yet to start it. sometimes I can't resist going out with  friends and that is really bad, because then I don't have time to study. I  don't know what else I\u2019m feeling right now. I\u2019m just sitting in front of a  computer in the pcl and typing along. even though the paper doesn't not need correct spelling and stuff, I still go back and correct it(I guess cause it's a  habit). right now I\u2019m observing people as they walk by. I really enjoy this  assignment, because it helps me to put all my thoughts and feelings on paper,  instead of holding them in ( as what I normally do)  I generally don't like to  tell people my feelings inside, I guess cause I\u2019m very paranoid and I don't  trust others with my personal secrets, even if they were really close friends  of mine. I can't wait until later(0:00p. m. when I go practice my throwing of  footballs. I\u2019m really excited about intramural football. most of the people  on my team are really nice. I\u2019m just a little scared about the real games b/c  I\u2019m afraid that the guys on the other coed I\u2019m teams will run into me and hurt  me. I was really sore this morning, after I woke up b/c of football practice  yesterday morning. football practice was pretty fun. I enjoy going through  all the drills and practices. at first I wasn't too sure about playing I\u2019m  football, but when one of my friends asked me to join her team I was like sure. our team makeup is kinda funny. we have all upperclassmen guys and mainly freshman girls. I just thought that was kinda interesting. well, I\u2019m looking  at the clock and it seems like I have five more minutes of writing time. right after I do this assignment, I\u2019m going to go study on the fourth floor. I really don't want to be left behind in my classes. I already am and that's  not a good way to start off my college years. in high school I studied  constantly and now I rarely get to study b/c there is so much stuff going on  and I usually give in to my friends when they want to go do something. I  think time really does fly by. before I know it, it's time to go to sleep again I wish I had nothing to worry about. I always wondered what my life would be like  if I was rich. it would be much more relaxing I think. well, it's already been  twenty minutes and I would write longer, but I really have got to go studying. I can't wait until I get to write paper 0, because I have a lot to say about my  college experience so far. \nAsnwer:"
