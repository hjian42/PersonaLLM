I would except I'm writing a stream of consciousness. I really miss PROPNAME. I just talked to him about 00 minutes ago, but I need to talk to him again. Boy, is my cell phone bill going to be high this month. Haha. I still haven't paid mom for last months bill. I probably should have read chapter 0 before starting this, since it is due tomorrow and this isn't due until the 00th, but I would more than likely had waiting until the last minute if I hadn't gotten this over now. Whoops. My poster looks like it is about to fall down. Oh well, I'm to tired to go and put it back up. Yet, I am still awake enough to sit here and type for 00 minutes. I wonder how much people write for this if they are slow typers. And I wonder if they read every one of these. Especially since mine is going to be so long because of my typing speed. Man, if I were a slow typer this would be a lot less work. And if I wasn't so diligent about punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Haha. Instead of spelling I accidentally wrote sleeping and had to erase it. I wonder if that is my subconscious trying to tell me something. I'm so glad I finished that photo wall. It turned out really nice, but PROPNAME didn't seem to like it too much because she didn't have quite as many pictures as I did to put up. Oh well, that's her problem. Man, my DVD's are really out of order. I'm not sure why I think they need to be in any order at all, because in the grand scheme of things, that really doesn't matter quite that much. You know what would really suck would be if my computer, out of the blue caught a virus while I was in the middle of this, and I would have to start all over again. Then I would just wait until the last minute and probably not type quite so much. Oh well, this is for science I guess. Man I really really miss PROPNAME. I can't believe I got so upset today when I was driving home, but what can you do when you love somebody so much. I don't know how his brother is related to him, he is so strange. At least he is nice I guess. I wonder if his blindness was caused from his genes or from some other problem when he was born. I guess that really isn't my business, but I'm just so damn curious. PROPNAME didn't seem to know, so I guess I'll never find out unless I ask him, and I don't know him quite well enough to do that. Man, my pinky is really starting to cramp up. I don't think I've written for 0 minutes straight before without taking a break. I hope my Calculus quiz tomorrow isn't bad, I did the homework and everything and my professor swears that it is enough preparation for his quizzes, but yet I still remain cynical. I guess I'll just go over the homework problems again before I go to sleep. I can't wait until that ORGNAME's show comes on A and E. Wow, I was so lazy I didn't even bother to find the and symbol. Haha. I did it again. If I wasn't on this laptop I wouldn't have a problem finding it. I wish it came with a 00 key pad. PROPNAME. PROPNAME. I can't stop thinking about that boy. He is such a sweet heart, and I can't wait to finish college so I can spend all my time with him. I wonder where A & E is. Haha. I found the & symbol. I wonder if there is some way that I can find out the channels on the internet through ORGNAME's website. Man this is a hell of a lot of typing. Hey hey, I see my Monkees bobble heads. They are so strangely entertaining. That's the only reason why I'm going to watch the ORGNAME special, (davy jones is on it wahoo). That, and because PROPNAME said he was going to watch it. There's the picture I have of us!  I can't stop looking at it or thinking about him!  I'm sure whoever (if anyone) reads this will wonder who PROPNAME is (though it's pretty obvious). I hope PROPNAME allows him to stay over at his dorm so he can come visit next weekend, and I don't have to drive back to LOCNAME LOCNAME again. I don't mind driving down there, it might just be nice to have a change of scenery and have PROPNAME visit up here. I'm going to be so worried about him though because he has to wait until he gets off of work to drive up here. There are to many drunk people out on the street for him to be safe, even though I trust his driving abilities. I think I'll have him call periodically on his way up here, just so I know that he is alright. Ya, that's a good idea. I should probably go and put those batteries into my remote but I don't want to get up and find it, nor am I suppose to get up from this typing and do something else. Man, PROPNAME drank all my Hi-C. Or did I drink it all?  Naw. Steph did. I distinctly remember having at least 0 left in there when I left on Thursday. I don't drink her stuff. Oh wait, I did but she told me I could have some. Man, that whip cream I got on my face earlier from the Frappacino still hasn't come off after washing my face twice. I can still smell it. Eww. It smells like babies vomit. PROPNAME!  Why aren't you here with me right now!  I know why you aren't here, but I wish you were!  Someday I won't have to worry about where you are all the time, and wonder what you are doing, but for right now this is torture!  Especially since I am writing all my thoughts down, and these thoughts of you are more obvious to me than normal!  All the thought I have in-between are meaningless because I don't consciously notice them, but when I'm thinking about you it takes all my concentration and full attention!  I should probably try and not think about missing you during class, but I can't stop. IT isn't like I don't mind these ideas, I just know that I won't be paying attention to what I should be. Hurray I'm almost out of time. 00 minutes. and a few seconds. Steph needs to put her stuff away and keep it away from my side of room. What is up with this. I'm not going to clean up after her. I'm getting so annoyed with her sleeping habits, but what can I do. I love you Byron!  I want to drive up there right now but I can't because of class! \nAsnwer:"
