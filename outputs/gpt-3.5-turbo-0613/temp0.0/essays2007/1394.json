    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: As I walk down the middle ORGNAME campus with thousands of people rushing by me on their way to class, I feel like a star in the huge night sky. With so many stars scattered throughout the sky, I seem to go unnoticed and lost. This is a feeling that I have seldom felt. As an allstar volleyball player, the student council vice president, and the homecoming queen I have always been one of the brightest stars. Just a month ago, I seemed to have my entire world in order and what seemed to me perfection. I now feel lonely and intimidated as I embark on this new phase in my life. I feel like I no longer have control, and perfection seems harder to achieve than ever. Knowing that if I do not obtain a B in Chemistry 000, my dreams of becoming a nurse are next to impossible. Can my life long dreams honestly be shattered by one college course? As I search for answers, I question whether or not I made the right decision to choose to attend the ORGNAME of ORGNAME, or if I'm even college material at all. What am I saying? Going to college was never an option for me. I want a good life for my family and I, and I've always dreamed of becoming a nurse and helping those who need me. My parents have always taught me to do my best and work towards my dreams, but words are often easier said than done. However, I could not have made it through my first week at the university if not for the love and support I have received from my family. Throughout my life, I would probably have to credit at least fifty percent of my accomplishments to my family, because they are my strong hold. Though I regard them so highly, I also feel that in this instance they are somewhat of my downfall. The transition to college would not be such a struggle for me if my ties to my family and friends that I have left behind were not so great. It is incredibly hard for me to accept change, because I accept my surroundings and others and become comfortable with them and do not want to leave my comfort zone. I feel that this is somewhat peculiar because I realize that even if I was to remain the same, with the same friends and circumstances, the world and people around me would continue to change and grow and expand. Eventually I would be left behind. As I work to achieve and to be the best I can be, I hope that along the way I will find the happy, positive person that I once was and know I still am. \nAsnwer:"
