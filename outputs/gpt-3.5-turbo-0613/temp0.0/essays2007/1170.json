Yesterday, PROPNAME (my roommate) and I went at 00:00 at night to PROPNAME PROPNAME to lift. I really have to use the restroom right now, so I will be right back. Sorry, I feel much better. My legs are so sore. I wonder what happens in a person's brain to tell his/her body that he/she needs to use the restroom. This TV next to me is really big, and I would like to turn it on right now, but I have more important things to do, namely writing this assignment. It would preoccupy me. I am really stressed out right now because I have so much going on. It gives me a headache. What causes headaches? Psychology is going to be a really fun course. I type really slowly, and I am trying not to look at the keys, but I am not doing a good job. My teachers are all great, and I lucked out with my math professor. He actually talks English. I wonder who ever thought of pencils and how they work. It is an amazing thing. Girls are wonderful  they make so happy. I have to maintain at least a 0. 0 to stay in the Business Honors Program, but I can do that if I really set my mind to it. Joining a fraternity would be so fun, but they are so expensive. My bed looks really comfortable. I always wonder if what we dream happens in reality later in life. LOCNAME vu is a feeling that I cannot explain. I have always wondered what happens inside the brain when this feeling occurs. I think that I have a slight obsessivecompulsive disorder because I want everything to be so neat and clean. I wonder if other people have this same feeling. I am always scared to talk about it in front of other people because I don't want them to think that I am weird. Who would have ever come up with the idea of the computer out of nowhere? They must have been brilliant. I feel a little lightheaded right now because I put a dip of ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME in my lip. I hope that I can quit soon because I have been dipping since my freshman year in high school. My back is a little sore. I wish that I could go to sleep now, but I have to read some MIS 000 stuff. Psychology is a huge class. It has 000 people in it, and that is 00 more people than in my graduating class at ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME last May. Well, it has been 00 minutes. Bye!  \nAsnwer:"
