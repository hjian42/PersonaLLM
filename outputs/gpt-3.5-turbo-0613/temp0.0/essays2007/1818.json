I wonder if he's at work right now. It's 00:00 there. Someone's being loud in the hall. Maybe it's those weird girls that PROPNAME and I had to   look at   last night. They wouldn't stop chittering!  And it was almost 0 o'clock in the morning!  I had to wake up this morning at 0, but I didn't get up until 0:00. I hate waking up early. My eyes are all sleepy, and I couldn't keep them open in Spanish!  I love my Spanish class. Prof. PROPNAME is quite interesting. Oooh!  The 0nd season of Friends is coming out soon. I should get that. But I like Prof. PROPNAME. I like his accent. This morning he told us that we (0:00 class) are going to adopt a poor hispanic family in December for Christmas. What a good idea. I need to go and find a service organization to join. I think a sorority would be fun, too, but I don't feel like paying for my friends. My friend PROPNAME took out a loan for her sorority at ORGNAME. Silly girl. But it's typical of her. Yesterday was my birthday. I don't like being at school for birthdays, I've decided. You don't get as much attention here as at home. I felt kind of lost, in fact. My roomie brought me flowers, though. And mom sent 00 million presents. But it's not the same as being there. I don't want to go home, though. I like being away from home. I just miss my cat, though. I like having something warm and furry to come interrupt my homework. He's so cute!  I also miss my dad. Poor dad. Mom's going to drive him crazy. PROPNAME told me that he's going to start kayaking more often. Mom needs to get out more. All she does is sit at home, read, and worry about me. Definitely a disadvantage to be an only child. But I did have a pretty good child hood. I had enough friends. Too many, sometimes. I really like that PROPNAME character on PROPNAME. He reminds me of PROPNAME. Only, PROPNAME's not mentally ill. I would hate to have to wake up as early as PROPNAME does every day. Four-thirty in the morning is insane!  Silly ORGNAMEs. what do they possibly get done that early in the morning?  Don't they realize that the majority of their troops are ages 00-00?  I've heard that people in that age group, and then teenagers as well, are prone to stay up late at night and sleep late in the morning. Makes sense to me. I would do it every day if I could. I like staying up late (when I have the energy). For some reason I feel like I can get more done at night. Like cleaning/organizing my room, for example. Why would I want to do that at night when I'm just as capable of doing it in the morning?  That doesn't make any sense. I need to change the song on the stereo. I'm not in a very UB00 place. Righteous Brothers are good. But this song reminds me of PROPNAME again. I hope that the Marine ORGNAME Birthday Ball goes well in November. I'm really nervous. What should I wear?  Good grief, I never thought that I'd type that kind of question. How flaky. But I am still wondering what to wear. Would a gown work?  And what color?  This isn't like a school dance or anything. This is a real thing, where Marines and their wives/girlfriends are there. Older people, I mean. I always feel so much younger on the base than everyone else. I feel like they're all wondering,   what is she doing with him?   or   she's way too young to be here.   My hands are beginnning to ache. I keep backspacing my mistakes. Perfectionist. That's me. I wonder if I really am one. Maybe not. I wonder where PROPNAME is. I should look at her schedule. if I can find it, I mean. My feet are cold. How do I keep that from happening?  And why is it that men's feet don't get cold as often as women's?  Is it some sort of evolutionary thing?  Or just another one of those differences?  I miss my friends. Maybe not all of them---they're kind of flaky. But I miss PROPNAME and PROPNAME. And PROPNAME. I couldn't believe that she didn't even call me yesterday. My mom told me that she has a present for me, but just didn't have my address. Whatever. She could still call me and wish me happy birthday or something. I don't get it. Sometimes I feel like she's the best friend ever. But then other times (*most times) I feel like I'm being left behind again. Why do I get left out?  I think I'd like me if I were someone else. Even when I'm with PROPNAME, or PROPNAME, when we're in a group, I'm not the popular one. I really wouldn't mind being that person for a change.  \nAsnwer:"
