Ok, it's 0:00 now. so if I just write till 0:00. This being on a web page reminds me that I need to get working on my boss\u2019s web pages soon. more like it makes me feel guilty that I haven't started yet. Oops, better throw that away. Boy my room is messy, wonder if my roommate cares. He said just so long it was on my side of the room, but . I'll clean later. Though I need to do more homework. (0:00. boy, I'm really watching that clock). Japanese is hard. I really should wear chapstick instead of just licking and chewing my lips. Geeze, this room IS messy. I'm glad my parents aren't here to see this, or they'd freak. They\u2019ll probably be irritated that the last e-mail I sent them was so short. I need to go get my course schedule planned out. I hope I can get my typing speed up, 00 wpm is fast, but I'd really like to improve my accuracy. I wonder if I should drop a class and get that job PROPNAME was talking about. Maybe I'll drop PSYCHOLOGY. Nah. Why is it that people don't accept pagans? Ever wonder that, reading person? Do they not realize that all of us are silly fools, and us no more than them? Oh, well. That quote was cool: Once dogma enters the mind, reason ceases to function entirely. Damned if I can remember who it was by. PROPNAME PROPNAME or something. Man my memory sucks. I caught myself forgetting what I was talking about in the middle of my sentence several times today. It's a wonder I can remember forgetting. Dam, what was I fixing to say? Probably need to condition the hair tomorrow or it  will be upset with me. And use my retainer or the orthodontist will hang me with it the next time I go in. It's cool that PROPNAME finally got her braces off, She's been wanting them off for a long time. She looks much better without them. Looks like Stona noticed (devious snicker). I really hope this doesn't turn out to be too long. Being able to type fast probably means that I'm going to get more down here than other's would. I wonder if they make some kind of odor-eater stuff for sandals. This things smell like the north end of a southbound horse. Hey, look PROPNAME's online. Boy I'd hate to be the people reading these. But then, I guess they like reading people's random thoughts, since they are in the Psych department. That hole in the stupid couch-bed here in my room reminds me of the one I cut in our couch at home playing with a razor blade. My parents will never let me live that down. Woah! It looks like my roommate had been home (0:00)! I should be more observant, should have noticed the change sooner. Home. my parents would be very pissy if they found out I was referring to this place as home  soon. You know, having to write these thoughts down really interferes with getting them in the head and processed properly. I mean, I'll remember the ones I get, but I'm not getting as many as I would normally because I have to dedicate so much of my left brain to typing this stuff. I would really like to be programming but I have so much homework. 00 hours is just too much, but I don't think I'd dare take less unless I had a reason. Boy I hope I can fond a job that pays well enough for me to stay down here over the summer and still be making enough to stand up the $0/hr I would be making in LOCNAME. You know, I can probably spell check this for you. hold on. Ok, well, that's kind of cheating, doing computer stuff while I'm supposed to be typing ,but I'll type a little longer to make up for it, eh? I was just checking to see if you were using a form mailer so I could have my emailer check the spelling for you. uh, oh, a message for ME? AHHH!  I don't understand this program! Oh, well. OH! I see. Ok. Nevermind. You\u2019ll have to get used to me, I suppose. I don't ever actually ask people questions, I just ask them to stand still while I say a question at them and figure the answer out for myself. The only questions I ask these days are things I don't feel like looking up in the reference manuals myself. I really admire Stona for making those \"What I believe in. \"  memoirs. I really should make some of my own. But then there's the book I'm trying to write and stuff and that's just too much. AHH! So much to do. Oh, well. Just have to forgo literary stuff to have time for the other stuff. Messy messy messy. Damn, why do parts of your body in contact with other parts sweat like hell? It's not like they're going to get any cooler by it, and your body is wasting moisture, you'd think that that would have evolved out. But then, I don't suppose that animals rest in contact with themselves often. I wonder why PROPNAME didn't take my Contact when I offered it to him. I finally have a book he shows an interest in reading, so that maybe I'll get to loan HIM books for a change, and he turns me down. I really wish he's come visit, he just keeps driving down to SA, like LOCNAME isn't even on the way there. And to see MY girlfriend. I'll just give him a guilt trip and he'll come by. Or at least, stay away from janice. Great, that means that now PROPNAME will think that PROPNAME has time to go down and see her but I don't and PROPNAME lives even further away. Super. She's going to be thinking that, I know. (0:00) This is long. But it is easier to do than I thought it would be. Maybe I should do this more often. It's a lot easier than a journal, and seems to g o a little faster. Go. I think I'll write a game of Go. That sound easy and fun. yep. Then I'll let PROPNAME and his happy functional programming self make the AI. Nope, there are some things I will NOT write in here. Thank you. I wonder how accurate PROPNAME's lie - detector tests really are. I wonder if some Yoga guy came in that has awesome control over his heart rate and blood pressure and sweating and stuff, if he'd be able to fool it. I wonder if I would. Prolly not. I suck at controlling my breathing rate. Which is really cool. Hey, person reading this, I have a recommendation for you: Meditate. Cross self-hypnosis with the meditation method of your choice. It works great. Trust me. Ok, well, it's 0:00 now. I hope you help someone with what I've written here. Thank you. Bye. \nAsnwer:"
