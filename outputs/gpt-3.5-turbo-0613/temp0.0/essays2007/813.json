I  went shopping with  friend. We went to a little store called oat willies it is  kind of a \"subculture\" store. it has been around for a long time. they sell all  kinds of hippy novelties- pipes, inscense, books about drugs, and probably drugs  too if you know the right people. anyways my friend bought some sunglasses then  as we were walking back a friend from highschool came running out of baskin  robbins to say hi. I don't know her very well but she seems really nice. then we  went into this vintage clothes store. they had a lot of really soft comfortable  looking t-shirts. We both tried on a couple. then the guy that worked there  accused us of stealing a shirt which was really weird cause niether of us really  had anything that we could have hidden a shirt in. he found this hanger on the  rack that didn't have a shirt on it so I guess one of his shirts was missing and  I feel bad for him but it was still kind of insulting to be wrongly accused. Oh  well no big deal for me I guess. so I bought one t-shirt for three dollars and  we left. maybe his lost shirt will turn up somewhere. next we went to another  little store that sells interesting odds and ends. Myfriend ended up buying a  bag that she really liked from nepal it was pretty cheap. then we went back to  her dorm room and hung out with her suite mates while we decorated her room. ok  I think it has been about 00 minutes I hope whoever has to read th \nAsnwer:"
