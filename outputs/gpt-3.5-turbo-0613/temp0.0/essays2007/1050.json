No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Today I thought mostly about school and how hard it might actually be compared to what I thought it would be. Precalculus seems to be getting harder and I think although I don't know that I will do fine. I absolutely love my intro to family relations class because it has to do with so much of what I love that is families and children. Children are my passion my goal is to help children and maybe someday have a few of my own. Families are important also I love mine and to me that is one of the most important things anyone can treasure. Everyone should have a family whether it be just a grandmother or even a dog. My family was very unstable for awhile but not one point in my life would I trade my somewhat dysfunctional family for one that may or may not be slightly more perfect. I do realize however that not every family is as nice as others I feel for the abused children spouses and animals in the world but I also feel that if you do come from a family like that there is always someone out there that was meant to help or become a new pseudo family for you. That is what is so cool about the world no matter how many weirdos there are out there, there are an equal amount of nice people ready to help those in need. to me this may seem way cheesy but its true. well I also wonder about my other classes such as history that class I had today and although it is very interesting I think that I got myself into much deeper water than I thought. That's funny how we use phrases like \"deep water\" to describe events in our lives. Think about those that spend years trying to learn the English language and finally come to LOCNAME to use it and we use all these nonsense phrases to replace easier words that would make just as much sense. How difficult for those that must take even more years to learn those stupid phrases we use so often. I can't imagine learning a language and traveling over to the land all excited and getting there to learn that the language you really need to know will take another year to learn. I am not completely sure that that is a high concern for our world but I am sure the computer industries are perplexed by this everyday. My mom works with computer engineers and she tells me that all the Americans say jokes and the ones that are from across the ocean are secluded just because of our ridiculous humor (which I happen to love. It also amazes me how random my mind works just by writing for twenty minutes. maybe that's the point of this assignment or maybe I am the only one that seems to be so random and thinks about a million different things at one time. I thought it was interesting that we were joking about how bad it would be for someone to make a cry for help about suicide in this writing assignment and that that really would be stupid because the odds of you reading one out of what 000 or so people in the class is pretty slim and well I guess that is all I was thinking about that. My dog is really cute and I don't exactly know what I would do without him. Any time I go home to visit I find one of the hardest things to leave is my dog. I find it so fascinating that in a world of chaos and poverty and violence that almost and I do mean almost everyone could have an extreme attachment to some animal if they were given the opportunity. I also find it ironic and yet understandable that so many homeless people that do not have money or food have dogs yet they cannot support themselves and then I think about if I was poor and all alone that I would do what I could to have a dog to keep me company. This world is so complex I don't know why I try to understand it. My brother had his fifteenth birthday yesterday and was talking to girls and is going to drive soon all at the same time. It seems that all of a sudden the boy that I beat up on numerous occasions is starting to fight back and actually coming close and I mean close to beating me up. I always new the day would come because he is getting bigger but it all seems to happen as soon as I leave to house funny huh? My older brother on the other hand grew up in 0 seconds and was out of the house before you could say bye. \nAsnwer:"
