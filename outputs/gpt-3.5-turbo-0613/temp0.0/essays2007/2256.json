So far it has been kind of boring really and I still have not received my math book so that kind of ruins everything. Ok not everything but it's not a good thing and wow 00 minutes is a long time. I want to watch this show on television but  I guess I won't so let's see what else I am thinking. The dryer is kind of loud and only 0 minutes have passed since I've been typing nonsense. School is also exhausting. I take naps like everyday and you know I actually like writing about nothing because why?  Hmm. Well, because I'm not stuck with a certain topic and I just have to decide what to write about. I would talk about smell but there is nothing exquisite in the air right now if that makes any sense. However, about 0 hour ago I was eating meatloaf that my brother made and it was pretty good but now I'm hungry again because I didn't have much to eat. So I'm thinking of going to ORGNAME and getting some delicious Mocha Frappucino. Is that spelt with 0 or 0 \"c's\". Anyways before I go to ORGNAME I may go to the weight room hopefully not the one at ORGNAME because I may still have other assignments to attend to and UT is too far of a distance. Man I wonder what time ORGNAME is closed. I also want some ice cream. I sure hope that I don't gain the Freshman 00 because that would really suck. I hope that doesn't offend whomever has to read this because I didn't mean to. I sure hope that I learn to manage my time later on or sooner actually. My throat or something hurts and I wish that I could just sleep all day. I hate some of my classes and I hate being in the Gateway Program. It's alright but not what I expected. I definitely didn't expect to take a class for that program but I am stuck in the most boring of boring classrooms. I feel like what am I doing there and can I get out of the program without hurting the Coordinator?  Also, when should I try to get out of the program?  0 more minutes to go. what to talk about? what to talk about?  Oh yeah, I had a fever last week and I hope that I don't get sick again this year. Another thing about the Gateway program is that I have to go to some social events and that takes time out of my life. I definitely don't know what to do. They like helped me register or whatever and I have to wait 0 hours and 00 minutes on MWF before my last class on those days which is Psychology and I have no idea what to do during that time and I tend to feel drowsy or sleepy during that class. Sorry. 0 more minutes. I'm looking at this sheet and I have no idea what to do with my UT email address and how to get into it. Does that make me dumb?  I wonder if I'm even going to get a response for that question. yeah 0 more seconds.  \nAsnwer:"
