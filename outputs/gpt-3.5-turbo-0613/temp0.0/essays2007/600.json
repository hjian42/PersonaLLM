No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I feel bad right now because my stomach is very upset, it's been upset for the past week or two and I'm afraid to go to the doctor, but anyway, I guess that's not really that important right now right?  I should really be thinking about school and the 00 hour load that I'm taking and hoping that I'll be able to pass all classes with and A or a B. my father did tell me that he would give me $000 for every A that I get and $00 for the B's. It just goes to show hoe desperate he is that he wants me to get good grades. but maybe ORGNAME is just too hard for mr  This is the only chance I have, you must do good PROPNAME, you must. I should really believe in myself and hopefully finish school faster than my brother did that way my parents will be able to take a break for one year and save for PROPNAME's tuition. We are five years apart. I wonder if PROPNAME will call me this weekend. It's been a whole week, maybe he doesn't care, maybe he just has someone else, someone better than me?  how could he treat me so bad all this time and me just be here waiting for him. I should stop thinking about all this and worry about other things. I really don't know how dad's going to come up with 00,000 dollars to take out those tanks from the gasoline store. We are just too poor. and how could abuelito be so selfish and not pay those 00,000 dollars that he owes in taxes on the mineral rights. PROPNAME is really upset because she doesn't think he cares much about anything anymore. which is partially true because the oil wells weren't his anyway the were abuelita's. boy do I miss her , even though I never met my own grandmother I know that she was a very beautiful lady. my dad must have been said when they told him that welita died. he would have stayed in the air force longer but I guess things just happen right, what I mean is it, it's 0:00  I still have about 00 more minutes to write. my mind is blank , I don't know what to say, this weekend when I went home there were so many flood charity things for the people of my hometown, LOCNAME LOCNAME, and for the people of PROPNAME PROPNAME. My mom and I should give all he close that we don' t wear anymore to those people. I can't believe how high the Rio rose. As we crossed the bridge on Friday I noticed that the river was completely back to normal but when I saw the pictures that my dad took of the river when it was high near welito's house it looked bad. I can't' believe all that stuff was under water. How could God do this to all these people. the worst thing about it is that it landed on the poorest of them all. the poorest are the ones that have to suffer the most. I hope that one day I can be rich and that I may be  able to donate a lot of my money to the poorest people of our countries. People shouldn't have to suffer in such terrible ways,      well, I sure do miss mom, right now she's in LOCNAME LOCNAME because she took pappy to the doctor. I think my dad might have diabetes and he doesn't know it. my grandfather has diabetes too and you know how dad is,  all his life he's always liked sweets. he has a sweet tooth, exactly like his daughter. I love sweets a lot. I really do, I always think that one day I might be the one that has diabetes and not my dad. I hope not though. but maybe if I did then I would be able to lose weight. oh well, anyway. I guess I better close this because I'm just about running out of time, although I wish I could keep writing because I kind of like just typing into keys and pressing down on them with thoughts that I have in my head. well, hope you like my confusing thoughts, or who knows, maybe you won't even read this. got to go. . :0) \nAsnwer:"
