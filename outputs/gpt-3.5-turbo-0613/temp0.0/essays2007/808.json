No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: it is about 000 and my roommates comp is making some noise and it has stopped now. I am now thinking about what I will (telephone noise) do when it is 000. that is when I will stop typing. I am thinking a bout my girlfriend. she is at a and m. I have a yaga sticker on my cd case. I took my cds out of my chest the other day, I mean yesterday, becaues I am not really worried about people stealing them any more. I once heard tht people sometimes steal toher peoples' pilows. my gir(keyboard is on my lap but io just took it off because I don't like that) I wish I could type faster but I can type plenty fast enough to do what I need to do. I have not really been using a lot of instant messenger lately. there are some people that I think it would be awkward to talk to like my gf. we kind of left withoutut breaking up but we both know it will not work ou. when I told my friend adam that she felt the same as me but I showed him her email and he believed me. she is not really like most girls and I said that was cool and he agreed with  me. I like to abbreviate when I typ and that comes from working on emails. I stopped for a seconnd to scroll up on the mouse because it does not move down by itself. I am now thinking how I do not type fast enough to say exactly what I think when I think it but I have to remember things (other things) as I am typing the thought that directly preceded it. my roommates are now staring at me as I type this and I am writing about it because that is what I am supposed to do. I hve stopped for a second to tell them about what the prof said today about the guy copyin gand pasting the computer manual and I thought that was pretty funny. my cousin did one of these stream of consciousness things and I don't think that I spelled that correctly. I think that this is getting pretty long enough and I will prolly cut it short before my time is up because I can. I know that rice university has the honor system and I don't know whether that would be cheating or not . it is now 000 and I have been typing for about nine minutes. whenever I write numbers I think it is easier if I just spell the number out but thinking back to this writing assignment, I have been spelling the time, so I don't know what that means. the social security comment was funny today. I accidentally came late to my french class today, the first day of school of all times, because I was playing squash and I thought it started at three instead of two. I actually think the yaga thing on my cd case is pretty cool even though yaga is not really a well known brand anymore. I would like to go to the gym todya but I would also like to et a  head start on the homework because I am still pretty motivated toward school, and I hope I will keep it up but I'm really not that sure because I know that this is different thatn highschool and I think I will like it more but my french teacher today told us some fascinating things about how speech is first started in babies and I was fascinated but then I went after calsss and apologized becase I was late. there is some real audo stuff we shoudl do for homework but I would like to do it in my own room instead of in the library becaus I don't know if we have to talk in to the computer or what. I am going to go now and I'd lkike to play some squash because it is fun. \nAsnwer:"
