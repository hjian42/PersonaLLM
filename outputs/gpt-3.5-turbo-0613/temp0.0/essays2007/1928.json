No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well I start typing now. so I don't really know my computer stopped making the fan noise why does it do that. the simpsons are on next door I could watch that but I'm stuck doing this oh well what is that oh yeah I like that I'm full even though the food is not good its all you can ear I love all you can eat. well since I don't really know what to talk about I can just write about things that I my phone rang can I answer it I don't think so oh well ill call them back I hope it was not JB calling about the hell raiser meeting damn oh but I can write bout things I don't really talk to other people bout like when I left I didn't really expect robyn and I to last really although I wanted to and but now it is not really that hard and I love her but kinda find myself wishing it was harder so that I could hav an excuse if I needed one to get out. but I have differing opinions on it mostly cause one moment I miss her and jus want to hang out with her but the next I get annoyed that I have to talk to her. and when other girls talk to me here I feel like I shouldn't even though there is no reason not to and robyn wouldn't even care the slightest cause she is so understanding and this is why our whole thing is not that hard. cause she makes it easy. that's the main reason I stayed with her cause usually I don't have relationships ever. this is mainly my first and definitely my first serious one which is another thing sometimes it seems so serious I'm like back off but when she acts casual I want her to act more serious. I guess the whole thing is stupid and I shouldn't worry bout it cause I am easy going and I should let things go with the flow I'm going to call dusting when I'm done so I can see if he is going to the hell raisers. wow it is quiet in here with no music I want to turn on ole PROPNAME but ill wait 00 min left this is going by fast. I thought I was barely talking. I wish I knew her name I talk to her everyday and she is in 0 of my classes and she introduces me to people and I don't even know her name that's kinda fucked up but I could like seinfeld introduce someone and she has to say her name. that would work I wonder when seinfeld comes on its not like it matters though all I really do anymore is read and study. quiet it is never this quiet my shoulder feels weird my phone is ringing again brb oh I am talking to jb about hell raisers that was easy I'm going to his room in well 00 00sec so I can wait no 00 - 0000 well 0000 now but yeah I think I'm going to work out after the meeting. I wonder if they let anyone in that 00s show is on I hear the theme song my computer sounds weird man a guy that robyn knows or knew shot himself in the face last night. it was sad supposedly he was mad or something and his gf was fighting with him and he shot himself in the face with a pistol right in front of her. robyn felt bad but I didn't know what to say really cause she has not seen him or talked to him in a long time so to me it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. this is getting long now that I'm looking forward ahead in the direction of I'm thinking of ways to say that differently alternately substitute words my eyes are getting tired I'm not blinking I need to ok wow that burned I shut them for like 0 sec and it burned it is better now jonathan thought he broke his toe and skarke got so wasted it was funny I burped and hiccupped at the same time. I wonder what this is going to say about me I don't really care though cause I think most of psy is just unnecessary over evaluation but it is interesting on a lot of levels the lie detector was cool though I think I could beat it maybe but well that's all \nAsnwer:"
