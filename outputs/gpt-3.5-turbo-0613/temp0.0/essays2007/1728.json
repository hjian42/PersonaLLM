No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am an adult person who has a culture, good background and origins that I'm proud of. I am an educated person who have attended full time school since 0 years old. I've traveled a lot and know lot of things around me. I am a ambitous person and very confident of myself. However, I've been feeling down for the last couple of years, I am not sure anymore where I'm going and what I want to do with my life. I have the feeling of wasting my time and being worthless. I've been living here for 0 years which is long but it seems to me it was just couples of months ago. MAybe because I have not seen any progress in what I have been doing. I feel like I'm waiting for something to happen. I used to be a very active person and very energetic, full of joy and ambitious. But I'm not sick, I'm still a healthy woman, well that's what the doctors say! Sometimes, Ithink the reason is I think too much of the future and I don't give time to the present  and enjoe it. But then when I do so, I feel like I'm wasting my time and I'm not being serious! It's like vicious cercle!!   In the other hand, sometimes I see myself of thinking bad things that I'm not supposed. I try to reject it and take it out of my mind but it doesn't go. Those ideas are like thinking the death of someone I know and who is very close to me, or a bad luck to her, or his,. I really don't wish that but the idea comes to my mind often and always feel guilty of it but I have hard time taking it away.  \nAsnwer:"
