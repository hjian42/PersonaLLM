No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      I cannot believe that I am finally in college at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, living the college life is such a tremendous change from the life that I have previously been living. Before I moved to college I lived with my mother, my father, and my younger brother PROPNAME. Also living with us was our many many animlas, whom over the years grew and other times shrunk. My all time favorite however would have to be my cat Magic, whom i was very upset to leave. Magic has been my cat for about 00 years now, and he has been there though so much. Good times and bad times. The happy and the sad. More recently, about a two years ago, we had a new addition to our home. My dog Rocky, who I miss incredibly. I never thought that I would get so attached to an animal, much less a dog, becuase dogs never were my favorite pets. In fact I never really cared for dogs. But however it happened, it happened. I am totally infactuated with my dog Rocky. I would take him everywhere with me if I could. It is so hard to be at college and away from him. It is almost like he is my son or something,I often feel the need to dicspline him, and however it happens, I find myself talking to him. I anxiously await the holidays that I get to go home to see him. However, even more than my cat magic, my dog Rocky, I miss my dad. My dad has always been the most important person adn thing in my life, for as long as I can remember, I have always looked up to my dad, admired my dad, and wanted to be just like my dad. I can't stand to part from him. We have been more than just father and daugther, we have been best friends. We hung out together, laughed together and cried together. I could always trust him and tell him everything, as I still can. He always believed in me and had the most faith in me, and most important he always trusted me and my judgment. I was the one who always cooked for my dad, and ran arrands for him. I would do anything at the drop of a dime for my dad, as he would do for me. It has been hard moving to college and being away from him. I talk to him everyday, but its almost like i don't know what to say. I hate the fact that I am missing out on whats going on in his life, and he is not here to see whats going on in mine,  It just not the same hearing it over that phone. I no longer know where he is at every second, and its a hard change. I am happy to be growing upp and moving on with my life, but i don't want things to change between my dad and i. It hard because the more i grow, the less i need him, and i like that i need him, and that he needs me. Although it is hard being away form my dad, and the rest of m family, it makes the move and change so much easier having my boyfriend of 0 months, here at college experiencing the change with me. He lives in the same dorm as me (university towers) on the same floor just down the hall. It nice to have someone who i love so much be here to support me. We are lucky to have all the same classes and schedule so we always have a familiar face a around. we spend all of our time together, which i love. Every morning I make him breakfast ( i love to cook)  before we go to class. I actually cook every single meal every day for him. But i love it. Its like we are married which lots of people may not think is a good thing at this age, but its perfect. I love him so much, and he is a wonderful guy. OUr parents have become best friends in the time we have been dating. Our paretns are even going to LOCNAME this winter togetrher. This summer, PROPNAME and I (my boyfriends name is PROPNAME) went to LOCNAME together,  it was the graduation present to us from our parents. It was an incredible vacation and expereince. I had the time of my life. We went to PROPNAME, and a few places in LOCNAME. . . Nice, LOCNAME, PROPNAME PROPNAME, adn my favorite LOCNAME. I love the shopping. My parents love PROPNAME and as far as I know his parents love me. It is the perfect relationshop and hopefully one day will be the perfect marriage, I know its a long way off, but hopefully not to long. I know that we can be together forever, however if things change, I will be okay to, I am always ready for change although I don't really like it too much. Its hard that we have still so much to go through being as this is just the beginning of our college lives, I hope that we can make it through it together. I have to work on not being so jeolous and controlling, and really just going with the flow. I don't always have to have things planned, and if he doesnt want to do things with me, i have to be okay with that. I am working on builing my own life separate from his and then i can improve my life with him. I am so anxious to start my life and be with him forever that i forget sometimes that i am only in college and a lot can change in the next four years. I am looking foward to the next four years. I just got in to the sorority of my choice (AEPhi). hOwever i am not even sure whether or not i definitely want to be in the sorority, i am not sure if it is really my thing or not. i am happy with my boyfriend, not looking for new guys, and i have never been the type to have a lot of close girlfriends, i think it may be good for me to associate more with girls. so i am going for it. if i change my mind i can always drop out later. well tomorrow is our first sorority party it is the Phi Tie party, PROPNAME is going to come with me, I guess i will see more how i feel about this whole sorority thing tomorrow, well i have to go, my time is up.  \nAsnwer:"
