I want to be involved, but maybe I am doing too much-   I wish I did not have eight o'clock class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I hate having to get up early-   I need to buy my Chemistry book and Biology book still. Books are so expensive-oh well-   I am excited for the football game this weekend!  It will be nice to have Monday off-   It smells like Lucky Charms-probably because I just ate some-   I need to get a transcript request from quad C to transfer my chem class from this summer to here-   I need to go by TOPS pics to look at pics from the other night-   I need to call my camper back-   I should do some reading for my classes tomorrow-   I am excited to do the SHINE program for the nursing school. I wonder who my professor that I get to help out will be. I need to look up hospital info online so I can decide where and when to volunteer this semester-   The people who live above me constantly make loud noises- are they obese people or just loud stomping walkers?-   I can't decide if I want to get my nutrition book- the teacher does not require it-but it may be beneficial-   I need to get some more picture frames for my room- I love pictures-   I am excited about a new skirt I bought today-wow I really got a good deal on it-   I like shopping too much-ever since I have been in college I feel like it has become an addiction-from school supplies to clothes-   I love how random my thoughts are right now-   I need to talk to my parents about sorority stuff and my credit card- that was a bummer when I got denied today at the coop-I should have just used my other card-oh well-   I can't decide if I want to go to the ranch this weekend-it seems pointless to go but then again it is only an hour away-hmmm   I want to download some ringtones after this-   I can't believe it's almost September- wow the summer flew by-pretty soon it will be Christmas-   I love hanging out with Katy-she is so sweet-   I can't wait to go to the rodeo sometime this year-   My neck has been itching lately in a random spot- I wonder why-   It would be fun to go on a random date-I wonder who will be first-Brandon or myself-hopefully myself-I need to be able to move on, but yet with a friend-   It's going to be kind of random meeting up with PROPNAME PROPNAME and she wants to sit with us-of course ORGNAME is already busy-I bet that is the only reason she has called- I hate when girls do that-girls need to learn time management with friends and guys too!     I want to lay out by the pool tomorrow-hopefully it will be nice and sunny -         \nAsnwer:"
