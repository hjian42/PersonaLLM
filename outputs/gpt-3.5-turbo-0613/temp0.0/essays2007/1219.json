No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: its 00:00 and I'm listening to an old episode of Saturday Night Live in my friends' room. I need a computer. I don't know why I didn't bring mine. I'm hungry. I can't eat because I have to type this assignment. PROPNAME has a lot of pictures. This is a pretty funny snl sketch. I have nothing to say. MY back feels a little sore. I'm slightly offended that there aren't any pictures with me in them. I don't want to do this anymore. I want to watch tv, instead of just listening to it. I really don't have anything important going through my head. It was nice of PROPNAME to let me stay in here and do this. Her and her roommate left, so I'm not even sure I'm supposed to be here. This song isn't that bad. I have never heard of the musical guest on this episode of SNL but the song really isn't bad. I really should have eaten before I started this. I'm about to pass out. Only 00 more minutes. I should call home later. I'm quite upset that I couldn't do the pretesting survey thing for the experiments. Maybe I'll try again in a little while. I want to change the channel. Some station has to be showing the U. S. Open. They just have to. I think someone keeps trying to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, but I can't tell them it isn't her, because I'm doing this. I'm interested how this assignment will tell how my mind works. It should be good to know. I hope someone explains it, preferably Professor What's his name. I would check to see what his name is, but again, I Can't. Just looking around the room now. This is kind of boring (no offense). Only 0 more minutes. Cool. The only bad part is I have to stay here until PROPNAME and PROPNAME get back because I can't lock up. There are just a lot of pictures in here. There are many of PROPNAME's boyfriend PROPNAME. Interesting that she's dating someone with the same name as me, isn't it. Snl is over and only 0 minutes until I'm done. That is a stupid picture PROPNAME has next to her printer. I like the opening music on this show (The Kids In the Hall). only 0 minutes left. That's good because I am still very hungry. This is very boring. I thought about using a lot of big words, but I realized that that isn't how I think so I should just stick with my sixth grade vocabulary. This isn't a very funny sketch. Phone's ringing, can't answer it. They told me not to. It's PROPNAME. she knows I'm here but I still can't answer the phone. she isn't going to like this. I'm done. \nAsnwer:"
