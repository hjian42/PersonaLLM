I really don't know  why I put the date up at top, just that I do that with everything, apologize if it offends you. Right now I am freaking out on my foot, which is almost killing me today. I swear I think I have the largest foot blister ever created currently on my foot and its not fun because I can't run, jog and it even hurts to walk on the thing. I have trouble putting on socks because the blasted  thing hurts so bad. I'm really beginning to wonder what I did to deserve that, I really don't think I've messed anyone up really bad lately. I've actually been kinda nice lately, which I usually am. Well, I guess nice unless you  consider what I did on Monday night. You see, some people keep calling up our dorm room and asking if its the PROPNAME PROPNAME library. I had been telling  them that it wasn't until I got sick of it. So some girl called on Monday and asked how long we were open. I told her we'd be open until 00:00 midnight  and that if she hurried she could catch us before we closed. I guess it was  kinda mean but I also thought it was really funny. Well, my hands are already starting to hurt me and that's not good because I have about fourteen minutes left. anyway, I'm starting to get hungry now but I still have more work to do so I figure I'll leave after I'm done with it all, which will take forever. Oooh, look at her, I guess I'm definitely going to have to move after I'm done here. Oh, by the way, I'm in the SMF at the library so I can be easily distracted while I'm doing this. I must confess I do that quite a bit, like the girl sitting next to me in class today, of course, I did listen to the lecture, but it was still kind of a distraction. Anyway, wondering what to type now to let you know  what's going on in my sick little head. Hey, you ever hear why ice is no longer  available at the LOCNAME A&M cafeteria?     The senior who knew the recipe graduated. I have alot of questions like that. For instance, if you throw a cat out a window, does it become kitty litter?  If olive oil is made of olives,  what is  baby oil made of?    Why is abbreviation such a long word?   Why do they put Braille on ATM machines?  Speaking of blind, what about those signs that say, \"No Eye Seeing Dogs. \"  I mean, who's that sign for?  The blind man or the dog? At the special Olympics, do they have reserved spots for non-handicapped persons? How does the guy who drives the snow plow get to work?   Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?  Does a radioactive cat have 00 lives?  If you shoot a mime, should you use a silencer?   If Styrofoam packs everything, what do they pack Styrofoam in?  Why is it that you drive on Parkways and park on  driveways?  If nothing sticks to Teflon, how do they get Teflon to stick on the  pan?   If ORGNAME is open 00 hours a day, 0 days a week, 000 days a year, why are there locks on the door?  Why is it that whenever you transport something by ship,  its called cargo and when you transport it by car, its called a shipment?  Why do they call it taking a dump when you're actually leaving something?  Anyway, those are the crazy things that go through my mind. Hopefully, I won't be classified as a loony and become subjected to further tests or something. Until next time. \nAsnwer:"
