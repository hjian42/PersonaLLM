No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: the end of this song is so weird. what was PROPNAME on when he thought of it. now this song is pretty cool. it bumps. too bad my sax solo was gay. I think that funk is the coolest type of music. I can't believe that maceo parker is  playing at antones. I am so there. I can't believe I remembered the number man, I wish I could get rid of my damn computer virus. what a pain. my knee hurts. I so stupid for busting it. I think that my dorm room has to be the coolest in jester. jeff is such a pimp. too bad he sounds kind of white. PROPNAMEsh is the coolest though. he's just about the funkiest drummer I\u2019ve ever played with. I don't know if I\u2019m supposed to be pressing enter, but if I don't I start writing off of the screen. I think that I\u2019m gonna like psychology. it's pretty interesting. I hope my stereo is bugging anybody. the concert tonight is gonna be cool. I just hope that I don't get killed. this song  cracks me up. I gotta leave in 00 minutes. I better have a lot of sugar to keep me awake. I can't believe how tired I was last night. maybe I should  have slept over at the girls place. I got to record my CD and send it to b. I\u2019ve gotta find out when I need to take defensive driving. these pizza rolls are so good. man, jester food sucks. the only good thing is the cereal. salads are ok. the pizza is decent too. my new hat sucks. it's really  uncomfortable. my brother is so whipped. me and my twin brother aren't really a lot alike. he is so disgusting when he's around his girlfriend. I guess that keyboarding class paid off. paid or paid. ly or lie. die or. . . well maybe not. what the hell am I talking about. this is a pretty crazy assignment. over half way done. it pisses me off when my posters fall off of my wall. CD\u2019s over. what do I want now. how 'bout a little screaming headless torsos. they are the coolest. PROPNAME jo PROPNAME is the most amazing drummer in the world. too bad I can't go to the first game. I still gotta get that sports package. some much to do, so little time. almost done now. my mind has gone blank. I\u2019ve got to wash my clothes. if I don't do that tomorrow, I\u2019m gonna smell all damn week. I\u2019ve got to read a lot this weekend. this is boring. I\u2019m sure who ever might read this cares very little about what I\u2019m saying. oh well. looks like my time is up now. just gotta push the submit button. bye. \nAsnwer:"
