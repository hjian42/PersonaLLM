I should have done this two weeks ago. well my girlfriend came by, she\u2019s in high school still, and she's going to miss the rest of the day to be with me, but first she has to go to the doctor. I really love her alot. damn I hate it when people call me and want all this information, they really piss me off. Dalmatians aren\u2019t good dogs once they get bigger. they are really mooding and alot are being brought to the animal shelter, I don\u2019t work there or anything, I just heard it on the radio. I work at the library, but I\u2019m not working today because I broke my finger playing softball with my brother, I got 0 hits, but its nothing like baseball, I\u2019m going to walk on at LOCNAME but I don\u2019t know if ill make it or not, but I\u2019m going to give it my best try. me and my girlfriend have been going out for a month now, we met about 0 months ago and dated a bit then, but nothing serious ever happened, that\u2019s probably because I was still hung up over my old girlfriend. but know its just me and her and we are in love. we\u2019ve only had sex once and I think that\u2019s good, because with my ex-girlfriend that\u2019s all we ever did when we were with each other, and it became pure sexual. I don\u2019t want that to happen with PROPNAME(my girlfriend now) I really really want to get serious with her, I think I found the girl I could spend the rest of my life with sounds strange, but I really think I have. anyway I wish shed hurry up and get back I miss her. I think the reason we haven\u2019t had sex more often is we never have the opportunity, her parents or grandmother are always home and my parents are home too, but I think that will change. I hope we stay together forever, and I know she\u2019s does because she feels stronger about our relationship than I do, so I know I wont have anything to worry about. six more minutes and I\u2019m finished, oh well I think this is fun. the simpsons are stupid, I use to like it when I was younger, but now I think its just stupid, I\u2019m going to kill myself, just kidding, my brother and his wife are both psychology majors, my brother went to swt for fours years and know is a police officer, and his wife went to LOCNAME for like 0, she was on the deans list and everything she\u2019s super smart. well I\u2019m getting on out of here, its was nice talking but I need to go to class,  \nAsnwer:"
