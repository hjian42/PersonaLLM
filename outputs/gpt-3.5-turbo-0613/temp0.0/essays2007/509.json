However, the weekends are fun. I get to see my friends that are not at this school. This weekend I went home to see one ORGNAME my friends who signed with the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also got to see two of my best friends that are guys. One goes to ORGNAME and the other goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME college. He was supposed to go to LOCNAME to swim, but two days before school started, he called, and they told him that his spot on the team was gone. Now he is writing other colleges and the ORGNAME coach called him. If he does not swim, he will probably come here next semester. I also got to see my boyfriend. He goes to ORGNAME. He was my best friend first and now we are together. It is great. However, I miss him a lot. He is the sweetest guy I know. Anyway, right now I am borrowing a friends computer because mine doesn't work. It is really a pain. I need to go tomorrow to the computer to have them install my Ethernet card. It is not compatible with my laptop. I am right now in the school of business. However, I am really interested in psychology, and am thinking of changing my major. My dad thinks this is a terrible idea. My mom thinks I should do what will make me happy. I guess I need to get as much information as I can about the type of jobs that I can get with a psychology degree and the amount of school I will have to complete. I will also need to see what schools have good psychology departments. I really do not want to go here next year. I want to go somewhere smaller with less freaks. I will probably stay in the state. I will probably go to ORGNAME of ORGNAME. Oh well, I guess I have a while to decide. \nAsnwer:"
