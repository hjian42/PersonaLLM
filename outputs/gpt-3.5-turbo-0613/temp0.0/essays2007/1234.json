No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well, this is interesting, writing for 00 minutes straight, I don't know if I've ever written for that long continuously before, this should be a welcome challenge. My roommate is bustling around the room, packing for retreat, and he forgot to do this assignment, he's running around the room packing and trying to do this assignment, haha, it's kind of funny. sucks for him that he forgot about this, he's going on a campus crusade trip this weekend, so I have the entire room to myself, wonder what things I can do with that luxury, hmmmm, time to ponder what interesting things can happen this weekend. Cosby show is on, I'm waiting to watch my favorite cartoon at 0 o'clock, dragon ball z. Japanese animation at it's best. I think I just have a thing for fighting and energy balls flying through the air and planets being blown up. I guess I'm just like a stereotypical guy. I'M football starts this weekend. I'm pretty excited. I signed up through ORGNAME. known as chinese bible study. should be fun since I get to meet some new people considering I came from a pretty strong contingent of people I already knew from the LOCNAME area, mainly centered around plano. LOCNAME is a really cool place. more things to do then in plano. but. not having a car kind of sucks. can't just go wherever. unless I feel like walking. which doesn't happen very often. only thing that is troubling is the weather. so freaking hot and humid and. just. nasty. can't wait until fall and winter when it's nice and cool outside with some rain and some mist. that'd be nice. none of this 000 degree weather. for a few months at least. Just got done with classes today. chemistry. right now it's pretty much a review of chemistry I I took in high school. so. not too troublesome yet. but the teacher is pretty good. she's really into the chemistry and lectures well even though most of the people already know how to do everything from high school. but it's nice to see the drive she has to teach and get the information through to us. my roommate just stocked up on food. he made a pilgrimage to the ORGNAME because he's lucky and didn't have a class today. no class at all. what a punk. well. I shouldn't complain. I have one class on Tuesday and Thursday. that's pretty nice. it's just calculus discussion too. so. I can get away with like. dozing off in that class. I'm going to lake travis this weekend with some friends. that should be pretty fun. get away from the city for a bit. and. get nice a dark. hope I don't get burned. and. don't want to turn the color of burnt toast either. I will no longer look chine se. hmmm. should I get a hair cut this weekend? I'm thinking about changing my hair. want to cut it shorter. because. it's nice and hot around here in Austin. shorter hair would be nice. considering I do walk everywhere for now. hmmm. provocative. maybe I'll ask some people what they think. then I can trek down to the drag and find a place to get my hair chopped. or. ear's lowered. whatever is the lingo nowadays. I have a lot of reading to do this weekend. what a bummer. I have to read the 0 books out of the odyssey for Greek. and I have a quiz on Monday. I have to read chemistry and start the hw. I have some calc hw I should do. and. need to read for psych. what a weekend. tons and tons of reading. but. football on Sunday. get to watch some ORGNAME and get to see how well my fantasy players do. hopefully I'll win in fantasy football this week. lost last week. kind of made me mad. my team didn't produce. but it happens. hmmm. hope I get to play basketball this weekend too. haven't played in a few days. and didn't play as much as usual this week. wonder if my skills have deteriorated. guess it'd be a good time to find out. just play some pick up game against some friends. hopefully I'll get to dominate. but. in all likeliness. I'll be toasted. nicely toasted. oh well. it happens. I'm really tired right now. I should have slept earlier. I don't know though. I slept around 00:00. I should be okay. that's 0 hours. maybe it was because my roommate was snoring so I couldn't get any sleep. kept waking up in the middle of the night to that hideous sound. that'll keep you awake. but once I hit him. he shut up. should keep that in mind more often. hehehe. hmmm. I'm trying to submit this. because I've written for more then 00 minutes. but I can't. hopefully I'll be able to turn this in on time. I only have an hour and a half to turn this in. well. hopefully all will work out for the good. \nAsnwer:"
