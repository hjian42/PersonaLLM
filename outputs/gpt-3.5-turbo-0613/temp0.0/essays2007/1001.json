I JUST NEED TO GET THIS FINISHED SO THAT I CAN GO TO PICK UP MY FRIEND. I TRIED TO DO IT BEFORE BUT IT WOULDN'T LET ME. THIS IS SO BORING. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO SAY ANYTHING THAT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT READ. THEY SAID THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE GRADED SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY BUT I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD MAKE YOU WRITE IT IF THEY WEREN'T GOING TO LOOK AT IT. THEY PROBABLY JUST SAY THAT TO MAKE YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. I NEED TO GO HOME SO I CAN GET ALL MY OTHER STUFF DONE. I'M KINDA HUNGRY. I HAVEN'T EATEN SINCE 00 THIS MORNING. I WONDER WHERE MY BOYFRIEND IS. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL ME AN HOUR AGO. HE PROBABLY WENT TO THE VOLLEYBALL GAME. I GUESS I'LL JUST LEAVE HIM A MESSAGE TO CALL ME WHEN HE GETS HOME. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK TO HIM TODAY ANYWAY. I THINK  I MADE HIM MAD YESTERDAY SO HES PROBABLY IN A BAD MOOD. I NEED TO GET SOME MONEY. I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO WORK MUCH. I HAVE TO GET AN OIL CHANGE AND A NEW BATTERY AND I HAVE MY INSURANCE AND PHONE PAYMENTS COMING UP. PLUS MY ONE MONTH ANNIVERSARY IS IN ONE WEEK. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO GET MY BOYFRIEND. HE IS REALLY HARD TO BUY FOR. ITS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE MUCH THOUGH. I SHOULDVE BEEN SAVING FOR A WHILE NOW, BUT I DIDN'T EVER HAVE ANY LEFT OVER MONEY TO SAVE. I THINK ITS BEEN ABOUT 00 MINUTES NOW. I'M RUNNING OUT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT BESIDES HOW I WISH THIS WOULD HURRY UP SO THAT I CAN FORGET ALL THIS BORING STUFF FOR A WHILE. I NEED TO START STUDYING FOR MY TESTS. I HAVE ONE IN ALL OF MY CLASSES FOR THIS WEEK AND NEXT WEEK. I REALLY HAVE TO PEE. THIS SUCKS. I AM SO BORED. MY BROTHER IS HERE NOW AND HE IS SO ANNOYING. HIM AND HIS GIRLFRIEND ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING. WELL TIMES UP. \nAsnwer:"
