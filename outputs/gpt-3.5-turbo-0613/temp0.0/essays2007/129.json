No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I'm really unsure about this assignment because I'm afraid I won/t be able to think of things to say for 00 minutes so I'll start off with why I'm so mad right now. last night PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME and I went with PROPNAME and trey to go coon hunting because PROPNAME and I went with them last weekend and it was fun, so anyway we drove for an hour to get to PROPNAME over this bridge that they hang prostitutes from no that was later first we went to this house that was so trashy that PROPNAME didn't even want to go inside to use the bathroom so she went outside that\u2019s gross then we drove to the place for hunting and  they made us get in the bed of the truck and trey drove about 00 mph and we were flying all around we played this I\u2019ve never game I didn't realize that PROPNAME and PROPNAME are just like me that\u2019s cool so then we go over this bridge that smells like shit or rotting carcasses or something and we were so scared because PROPNAME was telling a ghost story abo0ut a bridge and then trey turned around and we went over the bridge about 0 more times we were so scared then we get to the field and PROPNAME was already being an asshole and they took the dogs out PROPNAME had begun PROPNAME had PROPNAME and trey had flip and they left the walker bitch spice in the truck so we start walking toward the creek which turned out to be raw sewage and I refused to go any further and PROPNAME screamed at me that I was a bitch and he didn't give a fuck what I did so I went back through the woods with no flashlight so I could get in the truck I have never been more scarred in my entire life I prayed the whole time and I took spice out because I was afraid that I was going to get raped and murdered or something I was bawling and trying to tell my parents through telepathy that I loved them and that I would miss them because I was going to die then I heard a voice yelling my name and asking for help it was trey he was coming back to make sure I was okay I was so happy then about  00 minutes later the others came back, they looked like night of the living dead with briars and thorns all in their hair they told me they wished they'd stayed with me then they got in their bras and panties because their clothes were soaked with sewage and we drove home the whole time PROPNAME is bitching to PROPNAME about everything and treating her like shit I think she could do so much better but she's in love and I told her that but we didn\u2019t get home until 0am and I had a 00 class that I've missed too much already but I made it and that has basically what has been consuming me today I\u2019m sorry if its not what you wanted. \nAsnwer:"
