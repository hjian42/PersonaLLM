I am waiting for my boyfriend PROPNAME to call me because we just talked and he beeped over and said he'd call back. The fan in my room is seriously getting on my nerves because I stripped something in it and it makes a funny vibrating noise. I guess I am nervous about writing this because my foot will not stop tapping. I am so tired. I do not want to go to my Nutrition class today. It's the same thing every day and it lasts for an hour and a half. I have so much homework to do also. I just found out that my e-mail in the UT Directory is wrong and I have no idea who to contact to change that either. My eyes are drooping so bad. I have so much to do today and just not enough time. I need to finish all my homework, go to class, go to the gym, take a shower before class, and after I go to the gym, and then read a book for my classical mythology class. I'm looking at the timer now and it is only on 0 minutes and 00 seconds. It feels like I've been writing for a lot longer already. I guess I should be lucky to even be on the Internet. My dorm, (PROPNAME), has had a lot of problems with Ethernet, and this morning (for the second time) when I awoke, my Internet would not work. It really sucked. My room is so dirty and I need to clean it. I hate making my bed and waking up to start another long day. My stomach hurts because I ate too much at lunch. The food wasn't really that great today either. I shouldn't have eaten any ice cream. I need to start eating a lot healthier than I have been. I feel bad that I have been cheating on my diet. It was a protein/no carbs diet and at first I did well, but lately I've been cheating. I need to go to ORGNAME today to buy a friend of mine a wedding present. I can't beleive she's getting married. I'll probably be the last of my friends to get married. Three of the 0 of us are already married. My eyes are soooo tired. I just want to crawl back in bed. I really really wish today were Friday. I can't even imagine what next week will be like. after all, the past two weeks have been short weeks. Next week is our first full week. I am so ready for this weekend. I am going home and sleeping in my own bed finally. The phone is ringing. It is my boyfriend, PROPNAME. I'm explaining to him that I have to get off the phone because I am doing this assignment. Okay he is gone now. I told him to call me back in ten minutes and he said he'd call me back in a little while. that means by the time he calls I'll probably be in my 0:00 class. Sometimes he gets on my nerves so bad, but I love him so much. I just feel like he doesn't hardly ever have time for me. It's even harder now that I'm in school. We hardly have time to talk because he's at work from six a. m. to 0 p. m. and I don't get out of class m-f until 0 p. m. By that time both of us have to eat dinner, and I have homework or he has errands to run. sometimes he comes and sees me or I go see him. PROPNAME isn't really that far. But it is an annoying drive. This summer we're supposed to move in together. I almost wonder if we'll still be together then. It makes me sad to even think about us breaking up. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me and I've never been happier. I've also never been sadder sometimes. I guess that's just part of being in an adult relationship. If we live together this summer, we're going to live in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I wish we could live in LOCNAME, but he would have to drive to LOCNAME LOCNAME every day. Oh well. I still have six minutes left to type. I need to call my mom today and see how my family is doing. They came up to see me on Sunday, but didn't get to stay long. It really is amazing how our relationship has changed. They finally respect me and give me my own space. Before, me and my parents argued ALL the time. Now we actually have phone conversations without even saying one cross word. it's pretty nice. I know it's just because they miss me though. The lights in my room are so annoying. the ones that came affixed to the walls are bright harsh florescent lights. the other ones we bought are sooo bright they hurt my eyes. I guess I'm not going to get to work out today. It's already 00:00 and I still have a lot to do before my three thirty class. I wonder what you guys are going to learn from all this babbling of mine?  To me, I wouldn't see anything interesting about a bunch of kids rambling on about their thoughts. Damn my typing needs work. I used to be a great typist, now I have to backspace a million times to get it right. It's terribly annoying. I think after I'm done with this I might sign up for my experiments for this class. I did the pretest the other day. it took way longer than I expected. My arms and hands are getting tired of typing. I can't wait until this is over. only 00 more seconds. that fan is still making that stupid noise, and my suitemate just got home. She always slams the door. I really need to clean my room and I guess I will in about 0 seconds. Okay well bye for now. I'm not going to finish my writing now that my 00 min. are up. I've got lots of other things to do today. bye \nAsnwer:"
