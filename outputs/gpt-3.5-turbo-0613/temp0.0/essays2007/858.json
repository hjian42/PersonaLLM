No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have just finished reading the second chapter of the psychology textbook for class today. My room mate is always playing spades on the internet. I type very loudly. My subwoofer speaker system really looks cool the way I have it set up on my desk. This is a very odd, but interesting, assignment. The combination of the fan and air conditioner noise is driving me crazy. It is like the drone of a prop-plane. My computer is constantly checking for viruses and is always making little \"engine\" noises while I am typing. My room mate has a very odd way of typing. As I am doing this assignment, I am hearing myself talk the words as I type. I am sure that I have always done this, however, until now I have not noticed it. I believe that I just heard thunder. we could use the rain. I can't believe that we had a pop test in spanish today. I have a knot in my stomach. I know that I did poorly on it. I have a great spanish resource. my 000 verbs book. My monitor also makes a noise that sounds like I would imagine electical energy to sound. I want to go home this weekend. I miss my brother. I am going to bring him to LOCNAME sometime to hang out with me and see the sights of UT. What time is it?  I wonder if my package has arrived in the mail room, yet?  I wonder what my dad thinks of all of my difficulties with the percussion ensemble here?  I would like to retreat to LOCNAME LOCNAME and bask in the glory of the crystal clear water and the LOCNAME LOCNAME. That was a very random thought. All of the intricacies of the human brain are very amazing. If my cardiothoracic surgery bid does not work out, maybe neurosurgery could be an option. I have never had a class quite like psychology 000. I like the fact that it is web based. If I happen to miss a class, it is relatively easy to track down what was discussed. And even if the web doesn't have the information, the study sessions should cover the material again. I wish that I would have attended the first study session. I wish that I hadn't signed up for the molecular biology honor society. my plate is full already. That is such a strange idiom. I wonder how it came about. I wonder if idiom is the correct term for that expression. I have a very nice printer. It's fast, silent, and very clean looking. I am definitely a strange guy to be admiring his Deskjet!  I had to buy a lot of books for my spanish class. It has turned out to be my hardest class. I do not think that I am going to take any more spanish after this semester. I don't think that I was truly prepared to take spn000k, but I must have guessed well on the PROPNAME test. I hope that my friend PROPNAME does well at ORGNAME this weekend. I can hardly believe that he was the number one defensive pick in the nation. It seems like just the other day when we were playing together for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. Now the guy is 0'0\", 000lbs. !  I really enjoy football and I miss the contact, but my I'M experience this fall should be a lot of fun without all of the bruises. I really want to lift weights tonight, but I don't believe that I will have time. I also want to train with PROPNAME, but I don't know what he has planned for tonight either. It feels like I have been thinking for hours, but It has only been a few minutes. This definitely reinforces the fact that the mind is better than any computer mankind can build. At least until some sort of artificial intelligence comes along. And even then, that won't compare because \"artificial\" is in the name. I really hope that my timer goes off soon and I can stop writing. I think that it would be really cool if I could guess the exact time the buzzer will sound without looking at the clock. It would be like ORGNAME. That reminds me of a kid who did a debate over the existence of ESP in fifth grade gifted/talented class. It makes me feel good to say that I have been identified G/T. That's very cocky sounding, but I don't believe that I have told anyone of my identification in years. I have a problem with cockyness. I had better watch out or someone or something is going to come along and put me to shame in embarrasing fashion. \nAsnwer:"
