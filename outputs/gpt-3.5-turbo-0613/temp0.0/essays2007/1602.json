No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      Ok so my roommate is sleeping ORGNAME I have til 0 when my scuba class is started to do whatever when I am done writing this. . . I think I'll get online ORGNAME talk to people like I normally do. . talk to my friends in RR since I haven't met too many peopel down here. . . well I've met them, just haven't gotten to know anyone. So I'll get online ORGNAME listen to music. . . I hope I can get another job offer since I want to go camping on the 00th-00th & my training for the PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME is o nthe 00th. . man I don't want to tell everyone to go sat night & tude on sunday because we already talked about going friday afternoon. . of course even going friday afternoon they have to wait on me to get outta class at like 0 I believe but still. . tehy'd hafta wait til I got out at 0 pm on saturday if I did get a job at the LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. I need some kind of job so maybe I should just go to the interview & try to get the job. . it won't be that big of deal if we wait til sat & I could even meet them up there if it's a problem. . . I want to work at Urban Outfitters though because I coudl get discounts on cool clothes & room accessories & it's closer & prolley less demanding that working as an usher. . Of course being an usher would be cool because of free concerts & stuff but at the same time I wouldn't be able to sit w/friends or anything at those concerts but it's ok. . . & starting rate for the ORGNAME is $0 which is more than I was making at ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. I think any job would pay me more than ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. . except of course LOCNAME but that's not a real job. . . Man 00 minutes is a long time. . Tru LIes was a good movie last night. . Ultimate frisbee was fun once half the guys left. . . I had no clue what was going on when there was 0 on each team but when it was 0 on each team I got better because there was less going on. . plus the guys had no choice but to throw it to me. . . There were only 0 of us. . we won though & I scored a point & assisted the winning point for our team so they couldn't have been that disappointed to have the girl on their team. . . I can't wait for the Two Towers to come out this winter. I'm so mad that PROPNAME lost that book! PROPNAME PROPNAME 0 will be very good too & I know PROPNAME is like counting down the days. . I can't believe PROPNAME' mom. . PROPNAME & I will always be friends despite the fact that I'm in college. PROPNAME is gonn agraduate & come here anyways. . I need PROPNAME to make me laugh. PROPNAME is my giudence counselor friend & PROPNAME is my fellow geeky to laugh w/friend. . you need both kinds & I'm glad I have both kinds. . even though PROPNAME has headaches all the time which aren't her fault. . I feel sorry for her but at the same time, she's a wimp. . & her many boy problems & many boys starring her down do get annoying. . that was so funny when PROPNAME noticed that after being w/her for like 00 minutes. of course she wAS TALKIGN a lot more than she normally does that night after working first night  at  ORGNAME ORGNAME & ORGNAME. . I was excited the first night PROPNAME talked to me too. the boy is gorgeous! Too bad he had a girlfriend. . not that that would mean we would've hooked up or anything. . just would have been nice to know he was available. I am drawing a blank on what to write now. . this fan kleeps blowing my hair & it's annoying me but I know this room gets hot when you sleep so I'll leave it on for PROPNAME. . i NEED to put a tack in the bottom of that paper there because that thing kept me up for like an hour last night. . I was so tired last night. I can't believe it took me so long to fall asleep. maybe I'll just take PROPNAME's idea & take a nap for a bit before my scuba class. this scuba class better be good because I really wanted to take a karate class or a self-defense class. not for the actual use of self-defense like the wussy girls taking that class. . I want to know that I can kick someone's ass if need may be. . I think I could put up a pretty damn good fight if I really did get mad enough. . even my play punches are hard acording to others. . that makes me feel like a butch girl though so I don't appriciate it when I am told that. Use those arms   Ugh! I shoulda stopped! Oh well! & the phone is ringing but she's asleep so she won't answer & there will be a message & that stupid machine beeps until you check it-good no message. . \nAsnwer:"
