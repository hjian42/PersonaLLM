It cracks me up every time I watch it. I really like my roommate. She is such a cool girl. It's weird how things work out. I was really scared about having a potluck roommate. Every day we find new things that we have the same. We have the same toothbrush, hairbrush, hair straightener, contact case, pair of pajama pants, caboodle for our makeup, pair of shoes. It's crazy. I really like living at ORGNAME. The food was really good tonight. We had this thing called \"mexican shrimp\" except it really didn't taste like mexican. It was just little shrimp in this sauce with red and green peppers over rice. Food is so good. I bought some Little Debbie Star Crunch and some ORGNAME ORGNAME at the store today. Little kids snacks are so much fun. I wanted some fruit snacks but they cost too much. PROPNAME (my roommate) and I are not having a good experience with fridges. Our first one leaked all over the carpet so we bought a new one but it gets extremely cold and halfway freezes our stuff. This morning I got out a Dr Pepper and it was all icy. We should read the manual and fix that. I'm excited that I am going home tomorrow for the weekend. I miss my family, especially my sister. This past year we were closer than we had ever been and then I had to leave. I don't have class on Fri so I am going home to see her cheer at the LOCNAME football game tomorrow night. I'm so proud of her. She is so cute and nice and always succeeds at the things she does. I also want to see my puppies. They are the cutest dogs ever and I haven't seen them for 0 weeks. I am also ready to sleep in my own bed. Although my dorm bed is comfortable, it isn't the same. Hahah- gosh I love Office Space. The characters are so messed up and hilarious. I don't know why we have the TV on. I am doing the writing assignment at my computer and my roommate is doing pretesting on her computer and we are both just listening to the TV. I really should go to bed sometime soon because I have an 0am class tomorrow. It was easy for me to get up for high school at 0:00 last year but for some reason I am having a lot of trouble getting up for my classes. I guess I am still in summer mode. Now the credits are rolling on the TV and neither of us is getting up to turn it off. I shouldn't leave instant messenger up when I am doing homework. My friends keep talking to me but I am doing this so I can't talk to them so the boxes just keep flashing at the bottom of the screen and it is really driving me crazy. The music on the credits is also driving me crazy. There is just so much rap music I can take. Oh man! Barenaked Ladies is coming out with a new CD and they are coming on tour to PROPNAME and I am so excited. I love their music so much. I do hope their new album is good because each new one seems to be more pop-ish than the last one. I love their old cd's when they were just in LOCNAME and hadn't crossed over to LOCNAME yet. Their concerts are awesome and I will be going to the one here. I should probably start saving my money. I guess that means I should get a new job. All I know is that I will never work in food again. I worked at Sonic for 0 years and it drove me crazy. I would come home smelling like grease and who knows what else. Yeah, those I'M boxes need to stop flashing. This is one of the most random assignments I have ever done. I probably sound like an idiot with everything I am saying. I really do like my dorm room. It is so colorful and we have so many pictures and posters up. I can't stand blank white walls. The walls in my room at home are blue so being here with white walls is annoying. I should really put some lotion on my legs because they are itchy. The only problem is that I hate lotion. That is my weird thing. Lotion and feet. Put the 0 together and it is an even worse thing. My sister makes fun of me but I make fun of her because she doesn't like anything touching her bellybutton. She won't even touch her bellybutton. Now our room is completely silent except for the clicking of keyboards. I feel like we need some music or something. I'm glad that meghan and I have similar tastes in musics because I wouldn't want to annoy her with something she didn't like. It's been hard finding a radio stations I like here in LOCNAME because I don't really know which station play what kind of music yet. I guess I have plenty of time to learn. Well- my time is up!   \nAsnwer:"
