I can't believed I failed to talk to  PROPNAME. No girl has ever had that much power on me. Its probably the sun kicking in. I can't wait to go to the football game on Saturday. LOCNAME  is definitely going to beat ORGNAME b/c ORGNAME lost last week to a weak team by more than 00 points. Calculus class is going to be boring tomorrow because the professor is going to continue his lecture on limits. I hope we get no homework or else I will be very busy Wed. night. That phone next door is driving me crazy! Why does PROPNAME have the ringer on so high? I need to buy the PROPNAME CD soon. The songs on that CD will pump me up and let me overcome my fear of talking to PROPNAME. I hope she remembers me from the concert and knows that I am not some weird freak. PROPNAME seems to enjoy studying Chemistry for no reason because he does the extra problems even though they are not due at all. I guess he feels insecure about his ability in Chemistry. I hope the ORGNAME win next week at LOCNAME. It should be a good game but knowing my luck they won't even televise that game. Who cares about the ORGNAME?  Tonight I want to email Steve and tell him my difficult conquest for a girlfriend. Maybe things will clear up the next few days and I will finally have the courage to do what I am so good at: socializing. I have never froze up like this in a long time. Maybe I am thinking too much about screwing up. I know I am better than that. Baseball season is almost near the homestretch. I hope the ORGNAME can catch up to the ORGNAME and go back to the World Series. My parents are probably trying to call right now and are wondering why the phone line is busy. I wondering how PROPNAME is adjusting at Rice?  I hope she is not getting too depressed about not seeing PROPNAME because I am not there to help her get through this hard time. I am glad I was there for her this summer because she needed a good friend who could understand her. I really miss her a lot but at the same time I know she will be fine. I sound like her parents. I wonder how PROPNAME's drive to LOCNAME is?  His dad is probably giving him a lecture after what happened to him this summer. This room needs more AC. AC. The idiot next door is blaring his music. Spice girls suck!  If he is going to listen to music at least show some taste. I think I am starting to feel the effects of the LOCNAME chicken. That stuffed dog looks like Snoopy. PROPNAME must be attached to this toy. \nAsnwer:"
