The air conditioner is broken, and beads of sweat are trickling from the back of my neck down into my chair. I hate being hot. I would so much rather be cold than hot. However, I could never live in a really cold environment. LOCNAME is my home. I would have to kill myself if I lived in LOCNAME or something like that. Just imagine, waking up at 0am to go to work, and having your car door frozen shut. That is my hell. I think the perfect place to live would be LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME, or of course LOCNAME. I am going to be one of those old people who move to the beach when they retire. My husband will have one of those fishing businesses where he takes tourists out for a fish in the ocean, and I get to laze around the pool all day. My grandchildren will come and visit me, because it will be an easy way for their parents to have some time alone, because every kid loves the beach. Oh the beach. I love the feeling of the sand through my toes. The salty air running over me, the feeling of the water on my feet. I love the ocean. I wanted to be a marine biologist when I was little, but then I found out I would have to be good at math and science. and that is DEFINITELY not me. I do love marine life though. I've been to Corpus Christi a few times in the last couple of years, and both times I have dragged my boyfriend to the LOCNAME State Aquarium so I could go and see the animals. especially the sea otters, they're my favorite. I hear the aquarium in LOCNAME, LOCNAME has a bunch of sea otters. I would love to go there. I have only been to LOCNAME once, and that was just for one night before I went to LOCNAME the next day. What a great state LOCNAME is. I don't know why the government doesn't pay for a family to travel there once every couple of years to make the stress go away. They do that in LOCNAME you know. the government (or your insurance) pays for trips to the beach because of it's natural healing powers. LOCNAME should do that. If we knew we were promised a trip to LOCNAME every year if we didn't committ any crimes, and we payed our taxes. everyone would comply. There would be no more murders, rapes, robberies, or anything of the sort. And if anyone is ever pissed off at the government for anything. well it will all be forgotten after a couple of strawberry daqueries at a swim-up bar in a 0-Star hotel over-looking the LOCNAME.  They say that having an aquarium releases tension, well just imagine going out on the ocean and seeing dolphins jump next to you on the boat, and whales splashing their tales. That'll do you good for 00 years!  God I need a vacation. Just a little weekend one will do fine. Maybe just to LOCNAME LOCNAME, or back down to the coast. hell I'll even settle for home--free meals and shopping in LOCNAME LOCNAME might cure some ailment. But I am pretty sure that the beach is my best bet. The best is late at night on the water. The stars and moon reflect off of the ocean, and everything is still except for the sound of the pulsing waves and the cooling breeze. I think I'll start packing my bag now. Damn, I don't have a swim suit. I'll stop at Target on the way out. \nAsnwer:"
