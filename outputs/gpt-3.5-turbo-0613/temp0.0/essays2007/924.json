No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am presently thinking that I cannot believe that I am actually going to sit here and write fo 00 minutes, that is a really really long time. Well I am also thinking that I am fivxing to go to aerobics from 0:00 to 00:00 and not only is it late but it is also going suck. But I need to get into shape. I am worried that if I don't go and excersise I am going to gain that dreaded freshman 00 which will not at all be cool. I come fram a town of 00,000 and everyone knows everyone and all their business so I am sure that if I go home whith any added pounds everyone will notice, and most likely comment. Well I just looked at the clock and I realized that I have only been typing for four minutes, and this really scares me because I do not want to get cramps in my hands. I hate to type, because I am not very good at it and on top of that I do not use very good grammar or punctuation, even after I checked and rechecked my work. So it does worry me that I will have to turn this assignment in unrevised. I cannot get itout of my head how weird I think this assignment is MY friend is now leaning over my shoulder trying to read the assignment and she is making me very nervous. i can not stand to be nervous. The girl next to me just call the little whistle on her screen which notifies her of new mail, and I was thinking that I love it when I hear that noise. Earlier before I started this assignment I checked my e-mail and I had one new message from my friend PROPNAME who goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, I was so excited to hear from him he is one of my really good friends. the lady that is in charge of the computer station just made this girl show her, her id and when she asked for it she was not very nice. Which makes me think of the fact that I very strongly dislike people who are rude when they are providing a serviece to you. I mean it is like they are getting paid to do this so I do not know why a little common courtesy is so hard to come by, I am getting really bored with this assignment because I am having a hard time concentrating on typing while at the same time letting things naturally flow into my thoughts. But I guess that you are used to that, I am like also wondering why I am acting like you are actually going to read this because I know that you are not and it seems stupid to sit here and just jabber about nothing, someone else just got the e-mail alarm and once again I am reminded of my most recent message, which I was very excited about, my friend next to me is the one I go to aerobics with and she is already all dressed in her aerobics outfit ready to go. she just interrupted me again to ask me for the instructions on how to get here, I do not like to be bothered when I am in the middle of doing somthing, but I have found that it is very not to be bothered when you are living in a small space with someone, because no matter how quiet they are trying to be they never seem to be quiet enough, I know glanced at the clock again and I realize that at max I only have to type for 0 more minutes which excites me very much. My fingers are cramping and I am getting very old with this assignment I am hoping that the next assignment will not be timed but I am under the impression that with my luck that is am improbability, I feel sorry for my friend she just started the assignment and she has no idea what she has gotten herself into, I cannot wait until she is done so I can ask her what she thought about. WEll MY TIME IS UP!!! \nAsnwer:"
