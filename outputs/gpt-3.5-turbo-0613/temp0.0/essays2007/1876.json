Actually this past week has been stressful! College is very different from highschool. In high school I never even had to study, but I would still make high A's in all my classes! Now. . im not really prepared for all this studying i have to do in college! arg!  Im pretty sure i can handle it, but im still freaking out over only taking 0 tests in each class the whole semester! and those two tests determine my grade. . thats just scary!  Anyways, today in general has been stressful. My mom had to go get an MRI today, and that can't be good. Shes been ok the past few weeks, but something is making her sick! and today also, i found out that my uncles lung cancer is back, we thought it had gone into remission, but no, it came back. This has been really hard for my grandmother because she has to take care of my uncle 00-0. And my grandmother is not in that good health either, but hopefully she can handle all this. And it scares me because my other uncle, also smokes! even though his brother is literally deteriorating before his eyes! but he still won't stop smoking. that really pisses me off! its just so gross and. . blah. Oh well, he has to make that decision on his own, i can't make it for him. Anyways continuing on, one of my roomates is gettin on my nerves. I have 0 roomates in total, and we get along pretty good, but this one roomate, ahh! shes annoying! shes always trying to tell me that im not doing something right! and its always stupid stuff! like, she told me i wasnt cracking the eggs correctly?! or that my grammar on my english paper is wrong, when i know its right! and the thing that makes me mad is i didnt even want her to be my roomate. You see, i got a housing scholarship, for gettin good grades, so i don't have to live on campus. Two of my other roomates got one also. The girl i don't like happened to be a recepient also. She totally butted in and said she wanted to live with me! what could i say?! noo?! of course not! so i said yes. Then during the summer i was hoping she would forget and not transfer her lease over to mine, but what do you know! on moving day, guess whose face i see right as i enter my apartment door, none other than the annoying girl! ahh! this is something that is making my life even more stressful right now too!  Sometimes i wish my parents could just tell me how to live my life, it would just make everything sooo much easier on everyone!  But i guess thats the college life, its just very new to me still. Like, i enjoy not having my parents there telling me to study, or when my curfew is, but i do miss that   parental aspect   that i used to have in my life. College has a bunch of pluses. and minuses. Its not all parties and having fun like some people. Well i guess it is for some people, but personally not all that much for me. (Thats another thing about my roomate. . she is always partying! like 0 days out of the week! thats overdoing it just a tad don't ya think?!?)  But anyways i guess i should write something about the psych class to get some brownie points. lol. I really like that class! its pretty interesting, and the professor is pretty cool and not so boring(like my history teacher who says. . and umm. . alot!!)Im thinking of changing my major to nursing, possibly to become a psychiatric nurse, or possibly a pediatrics nurse. but im not sure(once again. . something i wish the parents could decide for me)  But yea, that class is pretty fun, i just wish it wasnt such a big class! thats another scary thing about college, your just a number! your just a tiny little fishy in a huuuge sea of other fishies!i guess its just cause im straight out of highschool where the classes are only 00 students each. Going from 00, to 000, thats quite a bit of a difference, and it can be rather intimidating for a freshman!  But i guess i will have to learn how to deal with it sooner or later!! hopefully i can survive this year, my goal GPA is atleast a 0. 0 ATLEAST! ahh!! i would like to have higher than that. . but we will just have to wait and see won't we!! \nAsnwer:"
