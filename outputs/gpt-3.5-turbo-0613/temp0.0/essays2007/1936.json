My friend told me about this song, and it's pretty good. It's about people being in love. I'm about to change the song to So Far Away by LOCNAME. They're my favorite band. My roommate isn't here right now. I just got finished eating with my brother. He is 00 and the best big brother. When he dropped me off at Jester that was the first time that I have cried since I've been here. I didn't even cry when my mom left. I guess our relationship is stronger even though I don't get to see him that much. I think my roommate and I are going to LOCNAME LOCNAME this weekend. I have a house on the lake. We'll probably invite a few friends to join us. I guess get away from the dorm life and act like it's summer again. Man, I have a lot to do. I need to return two books, mail a couple of letters, and some other stuff. I should be writing this down. Oh well. Hmmm. I'm running out of things to talk about. Oh yeah, the smell. It smells kinda funny in here because we had chicken wings the other day, and we still haven't cleaned out the dishes. Oh yeah, I have to do laundry too. PROPNAME, that's going to be a pain. I have tons of laundry to do. I'll probably wait until this weekend because then I can use my own washer and dryer. I won't have to wait for anyone else. Now I have to go to the bathroom. I wonder if that counts off if I stop for a second. Well, I'm going to try and hold it in. I wish we had a bathroom in here. Then it wouldn't be that big of a hassle to go to the bathroom real quick. Hmmm. my roommate and I have been hearing these strange noises from the room above us. It sounds like this people are having sex like the bed is moving or something. We're not sure yet, but I think we're going to go up there and see what's going on. We thought it was a laundry room, but who knows. I've been trying to find this song. I know the tune of it. I just can't place the words so I'm having no luck. I'm just adding words that sound good. I heard it in my brother's car, but he was talking and I didn't want to interrupt. I'm looking at some pictures on my wall. Wait. someone just sent me a text message. It was a guy named PROPNAME. I met him last Sunday walking passed his room. He seems like a nice guy. We went out last night to a movie in PROPNAME. We got there early so we had about an hour and a half to spare. So, we decided to take a look around Dobie's room so we just started knocking on doors and taking a look at people's rooms. It was crazy, but I liked it. Nothing was planned out. We just started hanging out and then we thought a movie would be nice and just went. It was excited. I hate having things planned out. I don't mind just sitting at home and being lazy. Just taking things when they come along. I don't know if. damn, I hate pop-ups. one just popped up while I was typing. Anyways. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad. Well, I have about a minute left and that PROPNAME guy is coming over. Perfect timing. I think things happen for a reason. I'm into reading horoscopes and stuff like that. I guess it's kinda childish. \nAsnwer:"
