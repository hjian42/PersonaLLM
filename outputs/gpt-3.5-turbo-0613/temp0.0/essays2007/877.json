But, I guess I will just go with the flow. I can't really get use to this computer, because it keeps skipping lines and messing up. I got it about one month ago. i guess that over all it is pretty nice. I am so full. I just ate breakfast , and I think that my stomache is going to explode. But that is okay. I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this. Sorry, this is a bit abstract. I would hate to have to sit there and read over five hundred of these papers. wow, it has only been five minutes and I still have fifteen minutes left. I can't believe that school has only been going on for two weeks. It is weird because it seems like I have done a lot in the past two weeks. But, it seems to be going really fast. I think that my next test is next week . who said. . sorry listening to leah anrioni. Most of her songs have to do with questioning god's or man's motives. it is actually interesting to just listen to the lyrics. I wonder whi write her songs. I guess I could just look at the cd, but I'm too lazy. I wdonder if I should call jr. oh, sorry that is my boyfriend. I would have to wait till I am done with this anyway. I wonder what my life would be like if I had gone out of state. a long distance relationship would not have worked. too much time away from him. and I guess too much room to doubt his/my actions. this is better, because later I can always go. when is the first test in this class? I hope that I didn't have to read anything for next time. god, I keep hitting thr caps lock. that is so annoying. I hate reading my professors book in religios studies. he probably made us get it just to increas the book sells. that woould be kinda funny if he read this. well, not really, but I would laugh about it in about a year. Three more minutes. I think melissa went back to san antonio today. I don't really want seema, my room mate, to come back. she is nice , but it has been nice to not have to listen to her talk all the time. I pretty much like my space. and she talks all the time. but I am sure that there are some very annoying things about me also. hey , my time is up. later. \nAsnwer:"
