My roommate  is on the phone so it's not very quiet in here right now. Last week my boyfriend hooked up the Ethernet on my computer. After trying to get it to work we finally got everything hooked up. It seemed to be working, well all of the programs  were working but when I went to shut the computer down it came to a blue screen and my computer was messed up. It said a bunch of stuff about pressing a key  to terminate a program that wasn't working, well I pressed a key and the screen was frozen. What's wrong!!!!  I restarted the computer and shut it down again and it still did the same thing. Today I turned the computer on and it did the  same thing. I called the computer center and after being on hold for an hour I finally go help, well I guess you can call it help. He couldn't help me but he set up an appointment for Friday with someone who will help me. Hopefully I can get this thing figured out. I just bought this computer a few months ago and  it was very expensive. Well enough about computers. I am a little tired. I had an 0 o'clock class, after the class though I came back to the room and took a  nap until 00:00. I think that made me even more tired. Well I need to start reading my English. I have a book I have to finish by Thursday. I am half-way through, but there's still 000 pages to go. I hate reading!  I read slow and it takes forever. That's not very good for an English major. I should enjoy to read, especially  because I will be doing a lot of it in the future. I am a sophomore student here but this is my first year here. This is a big change, I am very close to my  family and it was hard to leave them. I am 0 0/0 hours from home so it's not that far, but it's still a lot of driving for the weekend. I went home this weekend. I was glad to be home. I'm not sure if I like this place yet or not. I think it will take a little time. At least my roommate is sweet, we get along good. That's a positive thing. The bad thing is that last night we found roaches under the sink. Babies so they're everywhere under the sink. It is really gross. I never saw roaches before so I freaked out. The weird thing is that we don't  have any open food, I guess the roaches are looking for the water and it's also  dark under there. We put a request in to have someone come and spray. They  haven't yet. I hope they come soon!  Well my time is almost up. This was really  weird just writing off of the top of my head. Actually it's kind of peaceful because I enjoy typing. Well I have my psychology class next, at 0:00 PM. I need to get ready for class. I need to check if they got the books in yet. Last Friday they didn't have the book in. Well my time is up so I will submit now. Until the next assignment. see you later!!!!   \nAsnwer:"
