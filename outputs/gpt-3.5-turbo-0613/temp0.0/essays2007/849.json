No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have a wondering mind so I think about a lot of different stuff within a short periosd of time. right now iim thinkigna bout home. I'm going home for labor day and I'm kinda excited. I really didn't want to go home but all my friendsa r o I might as well too. I bet my parents miss me a lot. thats y they send me e-mails oftn. its hard being the first to leave home. bc I don't want them to be sad bc I'm gona but I know they r. my mom cried all the way home I bet. she alwasy cries when I leave for long periods of time. u know that guy I  saw at church the other day was pretty cute. I think I really liked him bc he was tall. its hard to fing a cute, nice, funny tall guy. especially when ur a tall girl. its hard being tall. everyone always says they wish they were taller and they'd give anything to be 0 or 0 inches taller. why? I'm tall and its not that great. true it comes in handy at times but its also a drag. its hard to find pants that r long and to find a good tall guy. I aslo get so irritated with people when they tell me I'm tall. I'm like hello! u think I didn't know that? no stupid I thin ki'm short! duh! I also get tired of it when people ask me if I play basketball. and when I say no, they try to convince me that I need to. if I wanted to play then I would, why can't they just leave it at that? would that be so hard? college isn't quiet what I expected. I thought it would be more fun, I guess. maybe once everyone gets settleed then it'll be more fun. right now all I do is study and work out, study and work out. its a visoiou cycyle. but its okay becaus ei am not going to gain 00 pounds!! I know thst for a fact. I won't let myself. if fact I'm going to lose 00 pounda at least by christman, I hope. I need to lose weight, I think. if I think I do, then y do ppl think they need to convince me that I'm thin enough? its my body y can't I do what I want with it? I want to start modeling after my first year at ORGNAME. thethat lady told me I could and that there  company would represent me after I got the braces off adn toned up a little. well the braces r gone, thank god!! and I've already lost a little weight. plus my legs r pretty much all muscle. except for my thighs. they need a little work but thats y I've been going to the gym everyday. plus all this walking around campus helps too. geez this campus it big! luckliy all my classes are somewhat close. but I still get sweaty when walking around. man, I wish my schedule wasn't so spaced out. its a pain in the butt to have a 0 hour break. next time I'm going to schedule them better. theres not enought time to really do anything in those 0 hours worth whild. all I can do is study, get on-line and go eat. which is probably y freshman gain 00 pounds when they get here. u have all this extra time to do nothing and so they go eat. well I'm not going to do that. I'll go eat but I'll make sure I go to the gym later to work it off. I can't believe my friend jesss bought her size jeans and the next size up. she is so thin, she won't gain any weight in college. she barely eats anything. plus she'll be walking around so much that she won't gain anything, some ppl make me so sick. they eat and eat and eat but gain nothing, I use to be like that buyt not anymore. maybe thats y I stopped eating so much, I was afraid I'd gte fat/ I dunnnno whatever the reason its probably for the best. I couldn't live with myself if I got big. I don't understand how peoipole let themselves go so far. i hate it when really fat ppl say they r tired of being fat but then they eat enough food for a small country. I'm like well. if u didn't eat so mucha nd exercised maybe u wouldn't be fat, ever think of that. that guy in med class is cute. he reminds me of a friend from home. he has the same humor as him, which is a good thing. mayeb something will happen with him, I dunno yet. I guess only the future will tell!! \nAsnwer:"
