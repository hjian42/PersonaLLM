It feels weird that I'll be writing about anything that is going on in my head right now. Looking at the keyboard. It's a black keyboard. I'm so hungry right now. I haven't eaten anything today except a bottle of Nouriche and some cookies. I'll be eating at LOCNAME after I'm done with this assignment. Is that what I am thinking about right now? Eating? Actually, there is no thought in my mind right now. Or it's just that I am too concentrated on thinking about this writing assignment. What's the purpose of life? ha-ha. I think about that a lot. What really is the purpose of life? People all die. Some people with their names left behind and some with no recognition in their lives whatsoever. How am I going to be like? Which of those two will I become? My parents expect a lot from me. It might be because I am the oldest child. But it really does put a lot of pressure on my shoulders. I know they love me a lot, too. Ahhh. What am I saying. Love. ?? What is 'true' love?? A guy falls in love with a girl. And does all kinds of crazy things for her. Then. All of a sudden. He falls OUT of love. And starts looking for another girl to fall IN love with. It doesn't make sense. Nothing in the world makes sense. I want to be an energetic, fun-loving person. But I tend to take things seriously. How can a person be fun? ha-ha. I met a girl yesterday. And she made us(my friends and I) laugh so hard. The entire time she was with us. I wish I could be that kind of person, too. Hmm. Stream of thoughts. What am I really thinking right now? ha-ha. I don't know again. I don't think I'm really thinking at all. I'm just concentrating on typing now. NOT THINKING. or am I? I am confused. &. &. money. I want LOTS and LOTS of money. Money can buy everything. Actually. Every materialistic things. I have 0 minutes left on the clock to write.

I have very weird dreams sometimes. And whenever I do not feel well. as in I feel lonely or sad. I get really weird dreams that make me feel really really really weird. I hate dreams that feel like reality. I've had many dejavus. 0 minutes left on the clock. I want this assignment to be over so fast. I don't know what to write. Well. I have to write what I'm thinking, but I don't know what I'm thinking. LOCNAME. Well. LOCNAME is a really hot and humid place. Austin is hot and humid as well. But LOCNAME is really really worse.
