It was so weird on PROPNAME's board I couldn't understands what it meant till I read it out loud I wonder if spelling counts on this and if you can go back and correct mis spelled words  like they care. I am so bored but so excite about the job I have essentially been doing the same thing for the past three years and I think that I can handle the work load but this is college and its suppose TO BE HARDER BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T BEEN I STILL NEED TO read some of the info in the art history book that girl pre adviser said it would be fun but so far it has been a snooze feast. what else to write about I though that I would have bad dreams after watching train spotting with the dead baby in the cradle but I really having been dreaming much probably because I stay up half the night hanging out with the hall everybody seems pretty nice and all the guy are hot especially matt oh baby but I think that he likes PROPNAME everybody likes PROPNAME she has that LOCNAME accent and she pretty and nice I couldn't even get drunk guys to dance with me on Saturday the only guy I danced with was p and then when PROPNAME said sorry to interrupt while we were dancing he said there was nothing to interrupt what a jerky think to say I mean I was standing right there it wasn't like he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying pritvi is funny but quite the little gossiper I really like my floor when they offer me a spot out side of supplemental housing I probably won't take I because I know so many people here and hopeful we can become good friends I haven't had any real friends for the past few years I been so involved in school but the weekends were so boring with out a school activity to do I seen a movie with a group of kids  twice one was after a school event and the other was after a church h think. I saw movies that I didn't want to see and it was pretty much like any other movie I've seen by myself but I remember them better I only have ten more minutes left I like to count I'm always counting things like yesterday I counted lance Armstrong bracelets 0 on the way to the theater building and seven on the was back PROPNAME's doesn't count could I didn't see it on the walk I am so bored right now but I am going to be so busy with soccer, broccoli project, circle k, and hopefully crew or rowing which sound the same to me but apparently with rowing you only have one ore and with crew you have two I don't know what else to right where is PROPNAME I so think that he forgot to knock on my door and just went off to lunch with PROPNAME. I can't believe he slept with jo I mean they had just met and a hour ago she had been kissing PROPNAME I mean if I was PROPNAME I would have been pissed what if all my thought were filled with profanity since I don't cuss I just thought about it constantly but I think cussing is stupid and you have to be a certain type of person to say certain words I sound so stupid when I cuss  \nAsnwer:"
