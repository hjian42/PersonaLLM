It was not in my mind at all so I totally forgot about this stuff. This assignment is taking me back to the seventh grade because in my English class. damn I keep messing up on my typing. well back to what I was talkin about. We had to write at the beginning of every class for five or ten minutes about anything that came to our mind; of course if we didn\u2019t wanna write a story or something. So what I would write a lot is something like \"I think this writing assignment sucks, . its stupid. and I\u2019m bored. I'm bored. \", on and on and on. I also just would like keeping writing the alphabet in random order. Well now I'm listening to this tired ass song from Puff Daddy, \"Ill Be Missin You\"  It talks about death of a friend. To me that is very scary. Cuz I always imagine how it would feel when you die or like where do you go. Its just a scary feelin that you don\u2019t know when we might not be here anymore. I had a few people that I knew die. Its just a sad thought. Now I\u2019m thinking about how college isn\u2019t that bad. Only if it wasn\u2019t for me being lost in Calculus. I mean I shouldn\u2019t have any trouble; I was Valedictorian and I feel very stupid, upset, frustrated, and scared. Oh shit. I just flinched cuz I got startled by the fact that some guy across the hall here just slammed the door very, very hard. Two times and said \"jack ass\" so loud that I heard him while I\u2019m sittin here typing in my dorm room. Well I need to start getting on the ball and do all my reading and homework, especially in Calculus. For some odd reason its just not clicking for me. and math is supposedly one of my best subjects. I guess that was in high school. and I even took calc. last year. Oh, now the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME song is playing. I think that that movie wasn't as good as it was in the previews. So now I don\u2019t really have anything else to talk about. Actually I cant wait to talk about my college experience cuz boy do I have some problems right now. Oh damn there's a phone call and I got up to get it but I don\u2019t know what happened. Well I\u2019m going to be going home tomorrow so I\u2019m not going to the UT vs. ORGNAME on Sat. I think I\u2019m gonna go to the library in a few minutes after I finish writing on here. I\u2019m actually finished so I guess I\u2019m Out. PEACE. \nAsnwer:"
