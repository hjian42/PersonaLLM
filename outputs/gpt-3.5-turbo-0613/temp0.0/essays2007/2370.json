No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:  I am so happy I can't really explain how I feel just that I am feeling great. I know the reasons why I am so happy I just feel like telling everyone that I am so happy and I just want to smile a lot. I would but other students would probably freak but then that's okay cause there is to many people here in LOCNAME that I don't think anybody would even remember the girl that told them that she was so happy. Anyways I have had so many hard days these past days butI think that I am going to be okay. I don't know why people don't even talk to other people unless they know them. Today I actually realized that eventhough austin is a big university I can make others see me. Okay right now my feet hurt so much I did so much walking today just like the other days. The difference is that I got blissters on my feet and they really hurt but you probably don't want to know that. Anyways I think I have lost weight because my pants fit me loose from when I bought them. Which is good because I usually don't loose weight or gain it just stay the same. Oh if I misspell a word I am so sorry but its just that when I am happy I can't really concentrate on spelling. I'll try not to make so many mistakes. I have gone back and captalized all the I's that weren't captalized. Right about now I feel my brain fried of so much thinking. So I met someone that can become a destraction in my education or can be the best thing that ever happened to be but I can't say who he is. Besides that I am really happy I feel like a new nickel very shiny through the inside and on the outside as well. All this happiness is thanks to God because he has not forgotten me of left me to survive on my own. So thank you so much Jesus because without you I would not be were I am today and who I am. I know that this might make someone feel unconfortable but that is how I feel and what I am thinking so no offence to no one in any way. I so wonder if my mom will come this weekened that would be so great but if she doesn't it's okay cuase I have her in my heart and in a DVD that my sister made for her. So any time I want to hear my mom's voice I just have to see the video and there she is that makes me more happy. I wish I could describe this feeling and share it with every one but I can't. It's great! Anyways my minutes are almost up but after this I am going to do other homework and get things done for tommorrow. I usually start early on things and wake up early to get other stuff done that's the way to do it. One teacher told me that if I wanted to get more of my stuff done to get up early and do them.   \nAsnwer:"
