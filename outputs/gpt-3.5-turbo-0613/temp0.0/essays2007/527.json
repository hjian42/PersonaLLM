My class was cancelled for today so I had the whole day off. I rented Sling Blade which I liked the movie had people with psychological problems like the guy who is always talking about women he killed and the main character who cuts peoples heads open every once in a while if he feel s it is necessary. The keyboard on the computer sucks since the space bar key keeps on sticking whenever I try to push it down. I am kind of nervous about classes because last semester I screwed up grade wise after keeping an almost 0. 0 ORGNAME for 0 and 0/0 semesters. I have never taken psychology before in high school and I wish I had since it would make the class easier now when I take it. I really can't type continuously for twenty minutes without having a definite subject so I keep having to stop and think of something to type. One of my goals this semester is to stop watching TV so often because that is what I feel screwed me up last semester since I was always staring at the screen either their or while surfing the web. Now I beginning to feel a little grossed out because I was just thinking about our dorm meeting where they told us housekeeping comes in only every other day to clean the bathroom when they used to come every day and it was still pretty dirty now it is going to be even worse. I guess it has been about twenty minutes now I forgot what time I started typing at since I forgot to write it down I thought I would have remembered. So I'm just going to call it a night. \nAsnwer:"
