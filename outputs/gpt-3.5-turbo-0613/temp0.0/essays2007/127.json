I am  slowly going crazy 0 0 0 0 0 0 switch. slowly am I going crazy. 0 0 0 0 0 0 switch. you know what?? this is a really really cool assignment!! I think it'd be cool if I could jut talk to someone like this totally going off on tangents whenever I want to. speaking of tangents. i hate precalculus!!!  I don\u2019t think I should take calculus in college cause my roommate( who I will get to later) says its really  hard and he's quite the WIZ at math.

I still have 00 minutes!! what am I gonna do!!!  there was this girl in front of us in PSYCH. today who my friend says is really stuck up and superficial so I kept whispering \"superficial\" to see if she'd turn around. she never did. so does this mean she's NOT superficial  or she IS. she just doesn\u2019t know it. as often is the case. I think this paper rocks man!! I bet ya'll get some really freaky ones like the end of the world  is coming to Austin!!!!  the ORGNAME video music awards is on in 0 hours0! what if I get like caught in the net and I cant watch the awards!?!?! that would suck!!!

I LOVE YOU!!! whoever reads this!!!  knowledge is power. and teachers go around giving it away for free~~how sweet!!! well actually I believe there were some fees included in this class. and its not like the teachers aren\u2019t compensated in some sort so Somebody\u2019s paying for them to  give away the knowledge. SO anyway. its been real. I'm actually sad to go. I've become so attached. talk to you later!!! love y a more!!! ~~~~~~PROPNAME \nAsnwer:"
