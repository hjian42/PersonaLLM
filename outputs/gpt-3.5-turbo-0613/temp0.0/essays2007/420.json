No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am going home for the weekend, and I'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. I miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. I mean, I'm not sad or anything, but I really cannot wait to get there. I'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at LOCNAME. memories of high school, things I did, things I said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, I often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. I think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where I want to be right now, most of the days, that's where I'd like to be. I think about the solos I took on various songs, the ideas I came up with, and the ones I'm coming up with now; I wish I could be in it to play them, I whistle and hum the different rhythms that I would play, my friend and I try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. I also am thinking about my family and friends, how I miss them, and how I'm going to them this weekend. I think of how I want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. I'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not I will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, I think about my sister in LOCNAME, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how I'm going to corpus this weekend. but I know that we'll see each other soon. I think about my room at home. the food I'm used to eating in corpus, how I really want to eat there because I'm tired of this dorm food. I try to remember as much about home as I can, but there always seems to be more that I think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when I was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. I just can't wait to be there, and I can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. I also think about my classes here, how I'm wondering how I'm going to do in them, if I'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. I hope that I will do good on my first tests, and I hope that the semester is not too hard as long as I study and keep up with everything. I think of my classes at high school, whether I was that smart or not, I wonder if I'm smart enough to be an engineer, I hope that I do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like I'm stupid or something. I think all of these thoughts right now, and like I said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like I'm thinking about everything at the same time, and I guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while I think about everything I can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph. \nAsnwer:"
