No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well I'm sitting here typing on the computer in carother's lounge and a girl just came in as I was writing. She looks foreign of course everyone here is foreign or Asian dissent. It smell like old rubber in here I hate that smell. I don't won't to write that paper for Religious Studies. I hate writing so much but my mom says I'm so good at it. She always thinks she knows what I'm good at or what I like best. that is one reason why I came to this school because she thought it was the perfect place for me. I don't know if it is or isn't but I haven't made any new friends yet mainly because of sheri she never wants to do anything she is so anti social. I am going to move into Jester next year  I feel she is holding me back  she never wants to associate with anyone and she never watches tv. I mean hardly ever good thing I turned the tv on this morning or I would have never found out about PROPNAME PROPNAME or johnny cash dying. last night right when the new was about to come on she flips off the tv. I need to know what's going on the world. PROPNAME's birthday is today I forgot she is so sweet I should have called early this morning like I was going to  I wasn't even tired  but sheri once again  \"do u want to wait until she is up\" and of course I had second thoughts and decided not to I should just call her after this writing thing by myself but that would make sheri upset I had it all planned out  we would be the first to wake her up and wish her on a happy birthday. I remember when I was a freshmen and was going to wish every body in our class from catholic school and call them up in the morning but I chickened out once again I don't know why I guess no I don't know why. I wonder what's ORGNAME doing  I hate him so much but I love him so much to  he lies entirely to much just to get girls to sleep with him but his touch is so good pennebaker class is going to be so hard  why is she so loud on her phone she looks like a complete dork. pennebaker's class is going to be so hard all of my classes are. out of all the types of test we had to do. it had to be analogies  my worst kind of concept I remember doing them in ms almanza's class they would be on the green chalkboard everyday and I hated them everyone got them but me. My sat score was low because of those stinking analogies. I remember getting my first F in her class but I can't believe she died I can't believe john ritter died she was so mean yet so nice and encouragelble I remember making those X-mas ornaments that we still used today we made homemade play doh and had to mold them into something I didn't know what to do I was so uncreative everybody had something neat so I resorted to making breakfast items  (perfect breakfast for a perfect teacher  I said)  I wonder because of that man's death I thinking of ms almazna death and the times in 0nd grade. PROPNAME cash didn't even win the VMA award instead thay gave it to justin timberlake  hell probably get about a dozen more awards while johny cash is dead sometimes I don't know society does the stupidest things sometimes  the jocks in that class are completely uncute I wonder how they will do in that class. they look dumb the jocks in our class were smart and dumb. I wonder what sports they play I want to ask so bad. I wish I lived in jester maybe I could find a new best friend someone like melodi she is already moved on and is having a great time she probably wouldn't if I hadn't told her to go out to dinner with those people. I won't to find someone like the other black girls in my dorm have I want a new friend to go somewhere with not like that black girl I thought she is kinda off what she had on today o my god. and binta is nice but kinda of rude  I knew this would be fun I don't want to stop \nAsnwer:"
