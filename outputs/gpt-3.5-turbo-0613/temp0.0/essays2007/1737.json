There is some guy in my room that keeps trying to talk to me and I don't know him. I wonder why he's in here. Theres a really old song playing on the radio. I havent heard it in a while. it reminds me of 0th grade. Every song does that, takes me back to a different place in time. Now this song reminds me of my friends PROPNAME and PROPNAME. I wonder what they're doing right now. I miss my old friends. I'm really excited about this weekend. LOCNAME is going to be a blast. I just hope that everything works out. I really want to suprise PROPNAME, but if I have to tell him I'm coming I guess I will. I really don't want to. That guy won't shut up. I'm thinking I might just take a cab from the airport to the university. My dad said theres a tropical storm. I sure hope it disentigrates before I get there. I hope everything works out with PROPNAME, though. I think this weekend is going to be the deciding factor of our relationship. Things are so tense every time we talk. I want to go back to that last night at his house. . it was so amazing. We stayed up the enitre night watching the meteor shower and talking out on his balcony. one of those moments I will never forget even when I'm old. I wonder what I will be like when I'm old. I want to be a cool grandma. I want to live in a big old house on some land but drive a really badass car and cook good food for m grandkids and spoil them. I guess b efore I  have grandkids, I have to have kids. which I don't want to do. I was watching the learning channel and MAN having those babies has to hurt. I could just have a c section. Thats what my aunt did. But then she died of cancer. Maybe I shouldnt have one. This cough is getting really old. I always get colds. Last time I had one was before me and John met though. HE brought me flowers for the first time. White dasies on the red tahoe outside of my room. I miss that. The note said he didnt have any soup. flowers would have to do. I love that. If I could right now, i would fly to miami and marry this boy. i remember the day my sister got married. It was the most beautiful thing i've seen. OF COURSE I WOULD DO IT DIFFERNETLY IF IT WAS MY WEDDING&gt; OK NOW MY COMPUTER IS FREAKING OUT&gt; UMMM I don't KNOW WHAT I DID BUT IT won't QUIT! OK THIS IS GOING TO BOTHER ME SO MUCH&gt; I HATE THAT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU don't KNOW HOW TO FIX IT&gt; SOMETIMES THESE THINGS ARE JUST TOO SMART FOR THEIR OWN GOOD&gt; MY EYE ITCHES BUT I can't ITCH IT&gt; WIERD&gt; I WONDER WHY YOU can't ITCH INSIDE&lt; BUT IT ITCHES ANYWAYS&gt; HMM&gt; I WONDER WHY YOUR FOOT WILL JUST FALL ASLEEP ALL OF A SUDDEN AND YOU can't WAKE IT UP&gt; WHY DO THEY SAY IT FELL ASLEEP? IT SMELLS LIKE PEANUT BUTTER IN MY ROOM BECAUSE MY ROOMATE IS MAKING A PB&J SANDWICH&gt; I  M HUNGRY NOW TOO&gt; I COULDNT EAT AT OLIVE GARDEN EARLIER BECAUSE I WAS COUGHING TOO MUCH&lt; BUT NOW ITS A LITTLE BETTER&gt; I SHOULD TRY TO EAT SOMETHING&gt; I WISH THERE WAS JUST A PILL THAT YOU COULD TAKE THAT WOULD BE FOOD&gt; IT WOULD BE A UNIVERSAL THING&gt; FOOD TAKES UP SO MUCH OF OUR TIME AND LIVES&gt; WE WOULD LIVE CHEAPER&lt; HAVE MORE TIME TO DO OTHER THINGS&lt; AND PROBALY WOULDNT HAVE SO MANY OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE&gt; THATS A GOOD IDEA&gt; I THINK IM GOING TO COME UP WITH ONE OF THOSE&gt;&gt;&gt; \nAsnwer:"
