No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing to inform you of my recent achievements, thoughts, feelings, and general relevancy of life. I have been under some stress for the last few months due to recurring repercussions of the recent divorce of my parents. I am and have always been one who stands and is ready to be strong for others, but some time it takes more strength to cry. I am glad that my involvement in dancing had led me to this time so near my departure for the Olympics. This had helped to separate me from the hectic antics of family. Although it has given to great an amount of time to reflect upon my inefficiencies. Again as I type I am thinking I am wondering as if this incoherent gibberish will be or can plausibly be translated into recognizable human thought and used in my aid. This in itself has become a major threshold of relief for me. Confrontation of my fears has always been a struggle. Fears a plague of man for centuries, we can find cures to anything but be most tormented by nothing more than our own conscious being. See, as I continue I have diverged farther and continued in my pursuit of happiness and my race against fear. I fear that I am losing control. Not of myself but of family. They stray farther and farther from the objective, but seem to relentlessly ignore the many warnings and offers of aid from their peers. Is it true that we are not safe from torment even without villain, or can it be that the most prevalent villain be he who lives within us. Tearing at each muscle and heartstring, pulling our every emotion straight from the gates of happiness to the pits of despair. I've dug myself into this hole and finally confessed, but the only my own strength can bring me out. Ironic isn't it. I am not nearly psycho or even remotely suicidal, but life can bring one down. A carefree person is at the greatest risk, because it is with that lack of care that you neglect to watch for the advance of the ranks of despair. I have yet to find the reason or meaning behind any so feelings. Let alone answer any thoughts or feelings of my own, but simple writing forms a haven, safe place, or a virtual escape from the locks of my own mind. Only as I overcome the fallacies that I have founded my realities upon, may I escape the shackles of my own torment. I really have no problems, other than an overly kind heart and mind that troubles me more than worth. How can I escape my own shackles when it is by the same power that I am confined that I am held captive. My thoughts are low and stamina lost but open freely now are the gates of hope. Once again proving that the pen is far mightier than the sword. \nAsnwer:"
