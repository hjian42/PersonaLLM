I was so awake until I walk into calculus in which the voice of the professor just made me want to close my eyes and fall asleep. Then my mind kept wandering. The year has just begun and I'm realizing that work is just going to get worse. I have to write a rough draft for RHE 000 that will be due next Monday. I have to start working on that. Then I have to remember that after Rhetoric and Composition that I have to cross the LOCNAME LOCNAME and go to the Mezes building so I can sign up for some experiments for Psych class. I would rather do experiments instead of writing a 0page research paper. Then my mind always wanders to this weekend. It will be a special weekend because it will be the onemonth anniversary of my boyfriend and me. I don't know what to get him. I have to remember to ask my best friend for suggestions. He's my first boyfriend ever and he has done so much for me. I don't know what I would do without him. I am so happy that my first boyfriend is someone special because I've heard of first boyfriends that don't mean much other than they're their first boyfriends. Then again, most girls have had their first boyfriends when they were as young as in grade school. I'm in college now. It's a little different I would think. Now, what do I get for him? It's such a hard question to answer and I'm low on cash. Well, I'm not low on cash, it's just that I'm given a $00 allowance for each week and I've already used up 0 weeks worth of allowances in less than a week. I need to be able to budget my money more. Then I've been using up my dining dollars faster than I should be. I'm about $00 under than where I should be. I'm really not good with keeping track of my money. Then I have so much reading to do in all my classes. The only class that doesn't require much of my time is calculus. Unbelievable! I'm so thankful that I took calculus in high school or I would be so lost because it's hard to understand everything the professor is saying. If I go back to visit high school, I'm going to go thank Ms. PROPNAME for being a great calculus teacher. I went looking through my psychology book and there are so many interesting things in there. There are some funny quotes and cartoons in there. I always found psychology interesting thanks to my psych teacher in high school. That reminds me, I'll have to thank Ms. PROPNAME too for being a great psych teacher. Oh, looks like time is up!  \nAsnwer:"
