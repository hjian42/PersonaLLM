I like my classes fairly well. Claculus and Physics will probably be the most difficult. Chemistry seems like it will be very easy. . and Psycology. well psycology looks to be very interesting. I talked to my sister last night. She graduated from UT with a degree in psycology. All she told me was,   don't get hooked. we don't need two psycology degrees in the family. and at least someone's got to make the money.   That someone being me. I really love my sister. she is a very unique person. Her life has been a blast. She likes to go places and have fun. . she's got a hugh fun-excited spirit. She's been to LOCNAME LOCNAME. . and now she lives in LOCNAME. I almost went skydiving with her a couple weeks back when I visited, but the weather got real bad the day we were going to jump. I think it will take me a litle while to totally accustom myself to LOCNAME. it's hard leaving the people I love. . my family and my girlfriend. I am in a very serious relationship. We've been together fro almost a year now. . and I think that we're going to make it through all this time apart and end up very happy together. Man this is taking a long time. I miss my brother. He is a marine. He joined the reserves back in January of 0000. last january he got a call saying his unit was being activated and he would have to leave for LOCNAME in two days. So mid january of this year he and one of his good high school friends who just so happened to end up in the same unit drove down to LOCNAME. From LOCNAME they were sent to LOCNAME LOCNAME for some training. they stayed there for a couple weeks, then were sent to the east coast. . somewhere near the cheasapeake bay area and had to go through a few months of training. They did some pretty neat stuff like riot training and stuff like that. he was able to to call us every now and then, and it was good to hear from him. Then after he was done with his training he was finally sent to LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME. There he and his unit were stationed for patrol duty. . basically they drive around the outer wall and patrol it. Since he has been there he really hasn't had much time to talk to us. He did take his laptop so he can get on the internet to e-mail, but he isn't given much time to do that. every now and then he gave us a call. He called the day of graduation to see how I was doing. I really wish he could have been there to see me give my speach. It was just not the same without him. He acctually called me here the other day. at about 00:00 at night. so I didn't want to talk long cause it was keeping my roommate up. But He comes home in November. . so it won't be ong before I see himn again. When he gets back my sister is coming down from LOCNAME to pick him up. . then they are coming over to LOCNAME to see me. . and we're all going to go skydiving!  I can't wait. I'm going back home this weekend. I leave tommorow right after my last class. I'll get to LOCNAME around 0:00 in time to see the high school football game. We won state last year. But my girlfriend is in the drill team. . so I'll get to see her perform, I miss her a lot. time is almost over. I've got a little moer homeowrk till I can get to work on a project I've been planning. I'm making my girlfriend a cd. . well actually two cd's. I think she will like them. It felt really good to sleep in a little today. Thursdays are the only day I don't have an 0:00 class!  so I like thursday. well. . time is running down. . only a few seconds left. . so I'll say adeu. . till we meet agian. \nAsnwer:"
