AHH, again. stop it. ok, less than 0 minutes left. what else what else. hunter is on the phone, hes been on all morning. i had to call nat a couple times. i hope his site works out. novotrix will probably die off though. TAC will be ok though i think. as long as he gets the snakes in he keeps saying he will. hmm, hunter is talkin to some girl. i can hear him on the phone. probably his girlfriend or whoever that girl is on all the pictures on his board by his bed. coach moore was a good coach. wow that was random. i should go visit the ridge for regionals this year, but i probably won't be able to. at least ill be there for state since im already here. ahh, times runing out. im trying to type faster, why am i doing that. i should ask on the message bored. jeez. that really is wierd. time is running out and i feel nervous or something and really rushed. everytime the second digits change i feel something in my stomach. \nAsnwer:"
