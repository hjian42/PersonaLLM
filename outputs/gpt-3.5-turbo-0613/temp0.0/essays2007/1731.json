I don't like to write, but I guess this isn't really writing. there is a hair stuck between the keys. Ans I can't get it out. it is bothering me. Why are my dogs barking?  Maybe my sister is home from school. I don't know what to write. My nose itches. I am hungary. I want to go to chilli's, but I don't kow if I can. I am so bad at typing. Man, I wish that I had my computer. I can't beleive that no one was here when it came. I better get it by this weekend. ok, i guess my sister isn't here. Then why were my dogs barking?  When is she going to be home?  She should be here by now?  What time is it?  Ya, she should be here. PROPNAME's sister is home allready. Is thst how you spell allready?, or do you spell it   already   with one l?  ah, it hasn't even been 00 minutes left. I think that I burnt my tongue on that kolache. It wa sgood though. I want that other piece of it. I miss my little kids from la petite. I wander if I should get a job there on just fridays. But, I don't know if I will have time to work and get all of my studying done. Probibly not, because I am already a little behind on my reading. I hate Chemistry. I really dread going to that class. I don't understan it at all. It's like the profesor just skips over the basics. How am I suposed to remember all that crap from sophmore year in high school. I should have goe to that help session thing. well, it would have helped if I knew where it was. I wander what PROPNAME is doing. Hopefully he is done with his interview and is on his way here. well, I know he isn't because he would have called me. Did he take PROPNAME out to PROPNAME with him?  bla bla bla. Where is PROPNAME?  I am getting worried, I should call mom. Maybe she stayed for tutorials or she missed the bus. I hope she is ok. I need to call my mom. I really want shrimp pasta stuff. That would be really good. I need to read. I have so much reading to do for biology. I don't want to take Amber to her school. What a pain in the but, I am never going to be able to finish reading tonight. I don't have time. \nAsnwer:"
