No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well i am beginning this assignment and already I'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing. Sometimes I wonder why I care about that stuff but I really don't know, and  my mind just wonders endlessly all the time, which I why I think I will enjoy this assignment, once it has been evaluated, because I seem to conjure up the wildest ideas, and thoughts and feelings when I begin to let my mind roam free. Now I'm thinking why am I thinking about my thinking which seems really weird, but I guess thats the idea ORGNAME this experiment, and I am constantly trying to think about what to think about next, so that I'll have something to type, instead of leaving a blank screen which would be bad, because then I would get a bad grade, even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion, not on content, which is a good thing because if it was based on content, and I had no content, then there would be nothing to grade, and I would have bad grades, and now it just occured to me that I am rambling on about nothing, and making fallacious points as I type, just for the simple reason to keep typing, which is the main goal of this experiment, and I just heard my roomate coughing in the living room, he is foreign, and sometimes hard to understand, but I think it's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because it adds a bit of variety to the mix, and he said that his parents live in LOCNAME, and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in LOCNAME, but had to move here to LOCNAME for job reasons, which is why he lives here, and which is why he goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME, and I know this because I asked him, and I asked him because I was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country. He says he likes it here in   the states   as most foreginers refer to us as, but he, like most teenagers, misses his friends back home, which is why he goes back there every summer to visit, and I guess since he has lived both places, and experienced both cultures and economies, is why he chose to major in International Business, and my other roomate, PROPNAME, is a business major at LOCNAME, and I am somewhat of a business major, with my major being Sports Management, which is in the ORGNAME of ORGNAME because it is a branch of Kiniesiology, which I don't know if I spelled right, but I supposed I should learn how,  but anyways my major is more of a business major, like PROPNAME and PROPNAME, which is pronounced PROPNAME, so that makes 0 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times, then I have another roomate named PROPNAME, whom I have been friends with since 0th grade when his mom babysitted me, and my mom told his mom that she doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people, but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to LOCNAME with him, and his sister PROPNAME, we stayed friends, and then his dad who lived in LOCNAME at the time, moved to LOCNAME LOCNAME when I was in 0th grade, yet we still remained best friends, though we only saw each other 0-0 days a year. I figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together, and such good friends throughout the years, and I hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology. Now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but I guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness, rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors. But anyways, as I was saying there are 0 business majors, then PROPNAME is a Chemical Engineer also studying at LOCNAME, and he, along with me and PROPNAME, who is 00, are all freshman, and PROPNAME is a sophomore. I sometimes wonder what its like to be a 00 year old Freshman, and to be starting your real life off that late, ever since PROPNAME and I have met. He seems like a very interesting person to me, and I figure I will get to know him better as the year progresses, even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time, rather than socialize together, but I guess its just nervousness of being alone, and without parents for the first time, and we will soon grow out of it. Speaking of parents, I hate to admit it, but I truly do miss my parents, and especially my dog, a dauschand, bevo, very much. Before I was to leave to move in to my apartment I couldn't wait to get out of there, and to get out on my own, figuring to be free of them for good, except for the occassional visits, and I would read the college things about how to expect home sickness, and I was thinking yeah right, not me, but just a few days after they had left, I already missed them, and I can't wait to see them again. Pretty sad on my part I guess on trying to be independent, but oh well, I just want to see my dog again, whom my life would be incomplete without, and the funny thing is for the first 00 or so years of my life I was afraid of dogs, and now I see the clock and I'm running of out of time, and it said my 00 minutes are up, so thats all I have to say. \nAsnwer:"
