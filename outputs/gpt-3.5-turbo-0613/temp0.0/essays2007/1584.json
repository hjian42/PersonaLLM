I'm mostly thinking about how great my day was. I haven't had a day this good in a long time. Even though I had to wake up early I was rewarded by my Cotton Bowl tickets which makes me happy, because I never win anything so it's really cool for me that I was the one who drew the best number. Maybe my luck is finally coming in. I hope so. In addition to the tickets I got to see the guy who I am totally in love with twice today which was simply a gift from god because I hadn't seen him in a long time. When I started to pray for him I got to see him on Tuesday, then when I started thinking about him even more, I got to see him twice, and he even spoke to me. I just wonder what he thinks about me. I doubt that he is thinking of me right now, but when he sees me, I wonder what goes through his head. I've never had a guy be truely interested in me before, so I hope that now that I'm in college, my luck will change. Judging from my lucky number with the OU tickets, it looks like my luck is changing,  but I can't say that it was just luck, because my rededicating my life to the Lord contributed to my current happness in a big way. Actually He is the entire reason why I am feeling the happiest I have since I have moved here. I have made good friends and I get to see PROPNAME. I just hope that I get to experience this feeling for a long time. I really am so happy, when I was walking down the street people were looking at me like I was crazy because I had this huge smile on my face. Being a good person and having faith can get you anywhere that you want to be in life, and now that I have accepted that I feel a little more at ease. Just a little though, I still worry about my classes. I just really want to do well. I need to catch up on my readings, which I will do this weekend. I just have to make myself. I also need to get my spiral back from PROPNAME. It really pisses me off that she borrowed my notes, and hasn't given them back yet. That is really rude and inconciderant! It's okay though, becuse now I am thinking about PROPNAME again, so I am happy. I can't believe how happy it makes me just to think about him. I know I seem crazy because I barely even know him, but there is something about the fact that he makes eye contact with me, and that he is the only guy to ever speak to me on this campus. It just says something about him and about the way that he sees me, at least that's what I think. I just really want to fall in love. I look around and see all of these couples, and watch romantic movies, and listen to love songs, I want it so bad, that I can feel it! Something in my gut tells me that PROPNAME is going to be my first real love, and even if it doesn't work out in the end and I get my heart broken, I feel like I'm ready. Ready to experience something. \nAsnwer:"
