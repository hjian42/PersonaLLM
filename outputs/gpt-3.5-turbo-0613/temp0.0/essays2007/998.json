That's a lot of time and to be honest I can't think of anything to say right now. I'm tired and hungry even though I just ate. Overslept last night so my body is killing me at the moment. Busted my head playing football yesterday and now my head is killing me. Glad I didn't have to get stitches cause that would have been bad considering that would cost a lot plus I don't like stitches. I don't like needles at all for some reason. I want to be a doctor though so that is kind of crazy. How can you be a doctor if you don't like stitches. Well a couple minutes have passed and basically I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. You want me to talk about my feelings huh. I'm tired, miss home, and uncomfortable basically. I feel good right now I guess, I mean I'm not cold or anything or hot. Just sitting here without my shirt in a chair. You told me not to correct my spelling but I missed the r in shirt earlier and spelled shit, and well I don't want to say just sitting here without my shit, so I corrected it. I'm a pretty good typer I guess. I know where all the keys are and everything and I don't make too many mistakes. I'm using ORGNAME and one of my friends keeps instant messaging me and well I can't reply back cause I have to get this done. I keep putting this assignment off, because I'm with this fraternity phi-psi and well it takes up a lot of my time and I really don't have much time to get on the computer and do this. I could easily have done it on paper cause we have to be at the house for 0 hours everyday for study hours. The thing is we don't have computers there and we are supposed to be in this room doing our homework, and well hard to do this assignment when you don't have a computer handy. It says to do it in seperate days, but I just finally remembered to do this. Actually I knew yesterday but the whole day I was at the frat house doing chores to get ready for the big party. I then went to the big party and had a good time. I know you're probably thinking, if you have time to go to the party then you had time to do this. My answer is true very true, but when you spend 0 hours getting ready for a party you want to enjoy it you know what I mean. I'm really tired of doing this. 00 minutes is a long time and there are some football games going and I want to watch them and well if I do then I won't be able to type cause my mind would be somewhere else. I cleaned my room the other day and so it looks pretty nice. My roomates side is really bad, but mine looks good so that's all that matters. I'm with the phi-psi fraternity and he's with the ORGNAMEs and well they are the biggest rival fraternities on campus. Don't really know much about it, except for the fact they hate each other. All I know is that phi-psi put a sign up in front of the ORGNAME house that said something like you can't spell faggot without ATO. That was pretty creative in my opinion so I give them credit for that. PROPNAME. nothing much to say, and still have a couple more minutes to ramble and ramble. I'll sing some songs, that'll pass the time. Under the bridge downtown I used to something something, o. k. so I don't know that one. It must be your skin cause I'm sinking in, it must be your feel cause I cannot feel, it must be your . O. k. don't know that one either. I remember when we used to sit in the county yard of brooklyn. Good times we had oh good times we lost a long the way a  you aya ay. No woman no cry. No woman no cry. Say say. Hey little sister, don't shed no tear. That's all I know about that one. I'm sure I know a song completely just can't think of any right now. Really don't listen to the words anyway. Always pay attention to the beat, cause I play guitar and I like to play and listen to the instruments rather than the words. I don't know just do. Time is winding down. To be honest I forgot when I started. I think it was 0:00 and well it is now 0:00 so it is almost time. Really want to watch the cowboy game, cause it's going on right now. Jeopardy themes song. Do do do do   do do do   do do do do  do do do do do do  do do do do do do do   do do do do do do   do   do do. O. k. that was a waste of time. I wonder if you actually time this. like if it is a test to see who really finishes this crazy test. 00 minutes is a long time, and well I'm as impatient as someone who really has to pee and is waiting on a stall. I like using analogies, makes things more interesting. Well I'm down to my final minute I think. If you are timing this than I tried to do the whole time, but I'm sick of being here. I'll give it another minute or two. Hummmm. That is all I'm thinking right now. LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME It's that off to work we go song. We whistle that when we do work at the fraternity. It's kind of funny I guess. O. k. I gave it another minute and well peace I'm out of here. Actually I'll be right back cause I have to do the other assignment now. \nAsnwer:"
