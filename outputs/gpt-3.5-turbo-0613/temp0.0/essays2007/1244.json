I hate how I called you wanting to merely tell you about \"our\" song being on tv and I got shot down. I hate how you called me some other girl's name thinking it was her that called. I hate how you can call some other girl and start to like her so soon after we broke up. You said that you had feelings for me merely 0 days ago and how can you forget about me so quickly? Was I just not that special to you that you could forget about me so soon? I hate you for not wanting to have a long distance relationship with me even though you're only like 0 hours away. I hate you for making me hurt so badly inside. I hate you for making me feel that horrible feeling you get in your chest when someone just breaks up with you. I hate you for having the power to invoke such emotion within me. I thought that you were different. I thought that you of all people wouldn't hurt me. You always told me to give you the benefit of the doubt and I finally learned to do that. You always said how you never wanted to hurt me and you never did until last night. Nothing you ever did was as painful as that. I just felt like someone had stabbed me and run over me a few times. I care so much about you still and I just don't understand you. You told me that you didn't want to have a girlfriend this first year at school, but then why in the hell are you calling a girl to get something started with her? How could you lie to me when I asked you who she was? You of all people never lied to me and never hurt me, but last night you ruined everything that I had made you out to be. I had you on a pedestal from all the other guys that I've been with and you proved me wrong. I wish you could feel all the hurt that I feel right now. I wish you could hurt so much that you don't know what to do about it. I wish you could take this hurt away from me because I don't deserve to feel this way. All I ever did was care about you and be good to you. I'm not sorry I still have feelings for you because you were just that special to me that it will take me awhile to get over you. I could never call some other guy and start talking to him so soon. It's so early and not fair to the other person. It took you forever to ask me out because you wanted to make sure you were over PROPNAME but what about PROPNAME? How can you talk to her so soon if I know you still have feelings for me? Am I just that easy to get over? I thought I was so much more than that. I'm not stupid, PROPNAME. I know you all too well. I know when you lie to me, but I guess I didn't know you too well because I never thought you could hurt me. I never thought you could be with another girl so soon after me. You told me not to start something with another guy to fill that void of you. Is that what you're doing because that's not fair. I just can't believe you. I wish there was something you could do to make me feel better, but I don't think there is. I don't even know how we can be friends anymore. I can't trust you even as a friend. I now know that you can lie to me. I wish it wasn't like this between you and me. I wish we could be together because things were so great with you that I didn't want to let it go. You were the best boyfriend I ever had but I don't know about that anymore. You ruined that whole perfect picture for me. I hate you for making me feel such sadness. How can you do that? \nAsnwer:"
