Yesterday, I had a bad experience. I saw my best friend kiss the girl that he knew that I had a certain attraction too. It really really hurt, but I have gotten over it. I can't really get mad at either one because first of all, we meet the girl at a club on Saturday night/ Sunday morning and two, my friend is a little more wild and social so he was talking twice as much than I was. The girl called me herself last night, but I told her that I didn't want to talk to her anymore because I had lost interest in her. As for my friend, he told me that he was really really sorry, yet he hasn't come up to me yet to show his forgiveness. I'm ok with it, I just don't understand how something like this could happen. I'm in question though, I don't know if I should be mad or not?  I think of one way, which is that I shouldn't let something stupid like this ruin a long, good friendship between my friend and I, or, if it was right to begin with that my friend kissed the girl that I liked after I had told him that I liked her. N E ways, good thing its all over and I'm moving once again with my life. I try not to let this things interfere with my everyday school life but at its impossible to keep them apart. For example, I could not concentrate all day yesterday because I was thinking of what had happened. I didn't read, I didn't do my homework, which is a very very bad thing. The good thing though is that I got over it and I'm back to normal. I guess its just one of those weird once in a while incidences. Today has been a much more productive day then yesterday. I went to go see what color band I would get for the ticket raffle of the LOCNAME vs. OU game. Unfortunately, I got the pink band, which is the least likely to have a chance to get a ticket. No worries, I wasn't really planning to go to that game, I just went to get the band because two of my friends asked me to go get it. I have a glow in the dark stars type of theme here in my room. I had never had the chance to have some in high school, so I finally did in college, and I just noticed that one of the very big stars fell off and is on the floor. I am looking at it this very moment, wondering why I'm not getting up and putting it back in its place. I also have the glow in the dark feet. My roommates, who are like really cool back from home friends say I'm a dork for having the stars, but none the less, I could careless on what they have to say because I think they are dorks too, haha. I see some dirty cloth on the floor and in that pile of clothes is my work shirt with I just happened to remember that I need to wash because I'm going to work tomorrow. Dang that a nice car, I just saw a blue ORGNAME pass by, very very nice car. Tonight, my roommates and I are finally going to go shopping for groceries. Its been a while since we have gone to buy food. Another thing I just remembered is that I need to clean the kitchen, its my week and I have to clean the pig sty (kitchen). I got a ticket to go to the LOCNAME vs. LOCNAME game and I hadn't realized that it was this weekend. My roommates and I were going to go home this weekend, but I can't go anymore. They are still going, but I'm not. I'm kinda sad because I wanted to go see my little nephew and stuff, but there is nothing I can do about it now; I'm stuck here in LOCNAME. I told my mom about the situation and she got kinda sad, but I told her that it'll mean more the next time I go down. Typical hispanic mom, she told me that I should of not made any other plans if I knew that I was going home, but that was the catch, that I didn't' know that the game was the same day that I was going to go back home. So what is going to happen is that I'm not going to go home after all and I'm going to the game with my friends. I just remembered that I was going to ask one of the LOCNAME's where SEA is, but guess I'll just have to figure that out on my own. N E ways, my 00 minutes are almost up, after this I'm going to hit the sack and take my usual 0:00 nap and wake up, clean the kitchen and go buy food. c-ya \nAsnwer:"
