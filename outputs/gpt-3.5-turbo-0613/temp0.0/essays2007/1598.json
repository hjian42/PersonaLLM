No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      ok here goes i am starting to write for my psych class and i have just switched my roommate. She hated the three of us and i don't really understand as to why. Well, actually i can because we did talk alot of smack about her but we gave her a chance and she never would reciprocate. So my new roommate is in the process of getting situated right now as i type and i wonder what she thinks about me. She seems pretty cool and i hope she is going to be the kind of roommate i was looking for all along. i really miss my boyfriend. He is working and i wonder if he is thinking about me at the same time as i do. i hope he will call soon for i know he will but hopefully not right now because i am in the middle of writing for twenty minutes straight. I just started thinking about how i took a class over the summer on writing. that was weird. anyway, ozzy ozbourne is on his show right now on mtv and i remember how my dad didnt think it was very appropriate that i watch the show when it first came out. That reminds me, i am upset since he doesnt think that it is appropriate for my boyfriend PROPNAME to come and stay with me until he has a place. i went to walmart today and was getting so frustrated with all the mexican people who were crawling all over the place. It was ridiculous. i wonder what my suitemates are laughing about. this sucks having to right this im telling my roomates about this project thing right now. it is for psychology. man my fart smells. i need to take a shower and dump. thanks for getting my new table. umm ya my lava lamp is purple and clear. shutup PROPNAME. hi lerrin. joe is hot says erica. my parents can suck it if he stays. i wonder what they would say if they knew that trey had stayed with us for a week since he cannot find a place in austin. he goes to southwest and i think the people there are incredibly nice, despite what some say. i dread having to read two chapters in chemistry but i know i will do it for i am the determined driven type. the ozzy show cusses more than i do which i think is incredibly weird. i almost threw out arielle's shit today because she made me go through the whole ordeal of moving in again and my mom thought i was pissed at her but i was just upset in general. joe suggested that i throw her shit out in the hall because she was being such a bitch. i wonder if i can cuss on this assignment?  well if not i apologize for my french. some la madeline's sounds really good right about now. i shouldnt be eating so much because you know what they say- freshman fifteen!  erica keeps bothering me about writing this thing i have to fart again. i want to go eat some pringles and ranch dip but then i will feel fat and probably be even more gaseous than already stated. do you ever wonder if people talk technically so they feel smarter as well as to sound smart. why do such people need to feel that way. just go through life doing your own thing and not worry about what others think because in the long run all of that will be forgotten. by lerrin. whats the point becuase the things that matter are all you will remember when you are dying in your bed when you are approximately eighty years old. my biggest fear is that of dying. sometimes i lay at night and wonder what it would feel like not to breathe and that is the scariest thing to me. i hope that i go fast or in my sleep so i don't know that i am consiously dying. did i spell that right?  well im too lazy to go back and change it anyways if it was spelled wrong. i am so happy i finally got my glasses in the mail because my eyes are just dying and i know that i havent been taking good care of them. sometimes i just think that i will get that laser surgery and i use that as my reasoning to my lack of nurture to them now.  I wish my best friend amy would call me. i knew that i would be replaced but i didnt think it would be so soon. i know soccer is a tough schedule at st eds but she doesnt even make an effort to call anymore but i am part to blame as well. im glad no one is instant messaging me right now because that would suck because i wouldnt be able to talk to them. stop interrupting me ashley and stop trying to be cool with kirby because she will figure you out quick and decide if she wants to make you her business. but thanks for running to walmart for me and im sorry i complained all day but its probably because i am on pms time right now. i wonder who is going to read these and what the real purpose is or even if you really do read this. i has made me feel better and calmer that i am typing about what i am feeling and thinking. i am worried about money and my financial situation right now. kirby says we are normal. i think she is really pretty and skinny. i am going to have alot of fun with her. but i hope that i don't get carried away too much because school is my number one priority. i need to get a job and i would be much happier. i don't even have enough for tuition next semester and my parents said they would help but they backed out and i have great resentment for that. i am tempted to ask my older brother but because i am independent i know i will not ask. i hope you enjoyed reading this. \nAsnwer:"
