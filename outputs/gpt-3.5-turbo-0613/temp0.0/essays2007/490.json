No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: This comp science lab is pretty nice and I'm kind of confused about what to say or do here. I mean I've been thinking about all this stuff lately and now that I come to write stuff down nothing really comes to mind except filler, you know, the kind of random thoughts you think that don't really mean much at all, I mean look at this thing I'm typing right now!  I didn't make the band but that's ok I guess more time for Geology 000 and PROPNAME isn't in it either so its all good. I want to go swing dancing tonight but PROPNAME isn't there (well and PROPNAME's line is busy so its kind of bunk) cause I take the bus, but it doesn't run as late as I'll be out.  Anyway. Um well lets see I guess I'm supposed to be writing about what I'm like thinking and stuff. Actually I'm wondering if anyone will ever read this, so I'm somewhat apprehensive: I've been thinking some pretty damn personal stuff lately so I don't really want to broadcast on the World Wide freaking Web. I also just typed a profanity and replaced it with a euphemism. I guess that's in case someone actually reads this too. PROPNAME. Hehehe that was cryptic, wasn't it??  See I'm kind of giving a vague notion here. I just type what I think. So there you have it. Wow Five minutes and my wrist feels funny. the FAC Typing things. keyboards, I mean. they aren't very ergonomic if you know what I mean and the surface of the desk kind of hurts. Replace Keyboard. Well it looks like PROPNAME is getting into this assignment, too. which is really kind of cool when I think about it. It will be interesting to me to actually go back and read the thing, cause I'm always editing what I write but now I'm just kind of going forward. relax. I don't know let me see well I'm kind of hungry, isn't that like part of the Id?  I always heard about that-- you know, along with Superego and stuff hey check it out I just read the instructions while I was typing that line and I didn't even miss any keys. Not bad eh?  This is kind of odd for me in another way, too  because I'm a Linguistics Major and well see I know most of the stuff they teach in 000 already, but the Professor seems cool enough. No more high school. Ten minutes to go. Living at home is ok. I can take the metro bus. PROPNAME is cracking up. If you read his (That's \"Kay, PROPNAME\") you probably shouldn't count it as much cause I can hear him stop typing to re-read what he already wrote and that's not ver continuous, now is it?  I hope I have enough money for food this week. $00 has to last me. I hat this space bar it sucks a lot. You have to hit it real no really hard just to make it go. see what I mean??  I hate it when people use adjectives instead of the proper adverbs. How hard is it to put on a little anyway?    My generation doesn't care, I guess. She's so smart. In fact she went to PROPNAME when she was a Junior in High School. Damn it I get mad just picturing her somewhere else having fun with someone else. But its cool I don't have to worry. or so I say. how could someone so Awesome be alone for long?   No no no. I only see her once a week. It will never work. Okay. well no I'm better. I didn't mean to go all mushy, in fact I'm thinking about going back and deleting that stuff. you know, in the name of science and all. Isn't that weird how I use the second person?  As if I actually expect it to enhance readability or something!  I guess I'm trying to make this whole thing like a VERY one sided conversation. Click click goes the happy little keyboard. My fedora is on the table. I learned the other day that its a PROPNAME Hat from LOCNAME and not really a fedora but its all good because I still think it looks good. People think I'm funny wearing a fedora all the time, but I don't care. They can just piss off. I get lots of ORGNAME ORGNAME jokes. Loss. I'm at a loss here. Ever since that paragraph where I talked about her it got all funky and now its happening again. No. I have a striped shirt on that's white and burnt orange but nobody said anything. I guess that's ok but I thought it was really nifty. 00 minutes seems like a long time at first but then I guess when you get to the end of it its not really  WELL DAMN PROPNAME is looking at my screen, that bastard. I had to stop typing for a sec to make him look away. I guess he didn't see anything deeply embarrassing. rrHahahah  Well times up. I want my cookie. \nAsnwer:"
