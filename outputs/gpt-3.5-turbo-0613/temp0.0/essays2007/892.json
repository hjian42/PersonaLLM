I was thinking today that maybe I should have gone to UTA. Oh well. I met people from LOCNAME today. It was great. I don't think I've said it enough but I LOVE \"Beautiful Thing\"!!  It's a great movie. I know I saw PROPNAME's name today on a sewer lid, and I wasn't being paranoid. I really should talk to Kent soon. I miss him. I was on the verge of tears telling the psychologist about PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME. It still hurts. I'm afrain not to take my meds. I can't wait to fall in love. Sometimes though I get very scared that I might mess someone else's life like mine. I have quite a bit of baggage and I'm not sure if anyone will go through. I miss PROPNAME. Damn allergies just hit me today. Peppermint Foot Lotion. Abuelita PROPNAME . . I wonder how she's doing. PROPNAME & Seehum were so cute. \"I'm going to make it afterall!\"  My frog makes a good pillow. I can't wait to see PROPNAME. She left for LOCNAME yesterday. I realized today I don't care what I do later in life as long as I have kids, friends, a nice house, and someone who'll always love me and be there when I die. Am I going to Hell?  I still don't know. Mr. PROPNAME would say I'm as good as damned now. Dying has so much stress attached to it. Maybe that's why I could never go through with it. I know that if I went back to a place like PROPNAME I'd give up and stay there forever or at least a month or two. I wouldn't care at all this time. I don't dream very much anymore. At least I don't remember them. I sleep so well during the day but it's harder at night. It's that damned melotonin crap. Commie Bastards!  Oh well. God I wish my nose would stop dripping. I miss PROPNAME sooooooo much!  God bless her. \nAsnwer:"
