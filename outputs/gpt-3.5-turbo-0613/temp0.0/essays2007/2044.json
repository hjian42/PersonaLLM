Someday by PROPNAME has got to be one of the best songs I've heard in long time. nothings wrong. just as long as you know someday. \" Ahhh well, good message behind it I guess. Every time I look in your eyes    I simply fall into your lies. It's fun to try to make up new lyrics to songs. Helps the creative process I get. I just ate some flavored ice and it tastes pretty good. although the grape had a strange aftertaste. Nothing else could affect me like this. Just your eyes and your deadly kiss. Words just keep popping into my head. I've been listening to this song over and over. Its actually on repeat. My plug only has one socket. I was surprised when I first saw that. Most have two. Oh well. Finally, you've returned my mind to me. But still you've left me nothing. So it's only been 0 minutes and I've written quite a bit. this is slow going. I guess water really doesn't boil if you watch it. People don't seem to call me much anymore. I guess it might be because I end up calling them but still. I don't know, it's weird I guess. This is a lot like writing a journal. free consciousness. I loved Catcher in the Rye. strange book though. I didn't like the other big stream of consciousness book. I forgot what it was called. All I see are visions of your face    Reminding me all of this was a waste. Hmmmm. my time thing doesn't show me how long I have left. I guess I started at 0:00 so I have 00 minutes left. \"Why weren't we able. \" PROPNAME really has some great songs. No One, Leader of Men. All seem fairly angry however. Perhaps that is why I liked them. Subconscious anger perhaps?        All you left were remnants of pain    Tell me what you thought you'd gain. My nose hurts. I should put my ring on. For some reason I always forget to put my ring on before going to class. I dropped my 000 Calc class today and opted for 000D instead. I thought perhaps learning second semester was more important than skipping to a higher level of math. It's all about the basics, isn't it? The only bad thing about this was that I also had to drop my philosophy class as well. so I'm down to 00 credit hours. This means I have to find something else to do. Even though I'm working, I kinda feel like I'm being lazy if I don't go back up to at least 00 credit hours. I'm only 0 credit hour above the requirement for a full-time student. Perhaps I'll take Tae Kwon Do or guitar. I think the Tae Kwon Do is only 0 credit hour tho, while guitar is 0. I hope I'll still be able to  start. That'd be pretty fun. The only thing is I don't really know what kind of exams I would get through those classes. Perhaps I'll talk to the music department tomorrow. I have to wake up at 0 tomorrow. I don't really feel like going to class at 0 in the morning. and my calc class still has it's discussions at the same time as before. so I still won't get a break until 0:00 tomorrow. Man, it's going to be a very long day. perhaps it won't be too bad though. Maybe I'll be able to figure out some way to pass the time. This has got to be more than 000 words. All I see right now is the finish button. It's calling me. slowly, slowly. \"instead of a hollywood horror. \" I also see the ORGNAME sign for my mouse. It's a really good mouse. Nice and cordless, as well as wireless. \". I know you're wondering when. \" So why do human beings miss such obvious signs pointing out problems? Do we really miss them or are we just blinding ourselves to them. Perhaps those are the same things. All you gave me were endless problems. Now show me how to solve them. I really like using the . , ellipses? Something like that. I always got it messed up. I probably overuse them. They're nice though. they show a pause much more clearly than a comma (in my mind at least). Also, they're useful in showing sarcasm. much sarcasm. \". now the story's played out like this. \" \"Nothing's wrong. \" Those just seem to stick in my head. I don't know for sure why. Perhaps I see my own relationships in those. I think it's almost been 00 minutes. I guess I should probably write for a little bit more just to make sure its been a full 00 minutes. \nAsnwer:"
