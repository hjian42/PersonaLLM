No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      000, I never actually listened to them. man my eyes itch. wow, Im supposed to be typing instead ORGNAME talking to PROPNAME. Man, this song is so melodic and soothing. It reminds me of sandy beaches and sunshine. Well anyway this is college, dorms filled with all of the decor of people's personalities and homes from their towns. Sometimes I wonder why people are the way they are. It's quite complex and difficult, but I'm sure their environment had a lot to do with their personalities and social qualities. I truly believe thORGNAME social qualities mean a lot. People need to understand that everyone is different and because, don't read this  PROPNAME. The song has changed into a classical melody and by the same band, oh no, Tool. Music, is a language everyone can speak. You can't go wrong with music. It's a huge part of my life. wow, PROPNAME ( tool song) is redone with orchestra instruments. Aenima is an interesting song about Armageddon. Speaking of Armageddon, is God going to come to LOCNAME, or PROPNAME for that matter. Biologically, we are just organisms living out our lives. And for what?  To not sin and go to heaven?  There are so many religions out there, I mean, controversy is going to be a given. Why is PROPNAME reading this. Is he interested in what is on my mind. Well anyway, Respect for other's religions is something I find extremely important and essential to understand at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. Instead of looking at a muslim and saying   holy shit what's up with that   just think to yourself how they see your religion and judge yourself. Live, and let live. Have respect. I feel as though people close to me in my home in LOCNAME do not realize the respect I have for them. They never realize, is this the same orchestrated song by tool, hold for 0 sec please. Alright some middle time ORGNAME, their a gothic punk band, that can be described as purity in darkness. They are one of my favorite punk bands. Sometimes I wonder what the lives of PROPNAME PROPNAME and Afi are like. They seem as though they are really nice people. Having taken a picture and briefly and nervously talked to them. Yeah PROPNAME PROPNAME, a legend. Now thats good stuff. I mean who doesnt like PROPNAME PROPNAME?  His music flows through your body like the many pints of blood do. You just want to sit back and enjoy a nice beverage, for me preferably corona and a nice tequila of some sort. Not partying or whatever; it's wierd how we use party as a verb. LOCNAME soldier in a war for LOCNAME. PROPNAME PROPNAME used his fair share of pot, but he did not die from it. Who dies from cannibus?  Is it really that bad?  Should we legalize it? LOCNAME's police force seems more concerned with other crimes than Marijuana. Personally,  I believe marijuana is better  \nAsnwer:"
