No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I can't believe I'm doing this assignment should be asleep right now I wish that my roommate would quit playing his music. My other roommate is a dork he's always talking about god and crap and telling me that I shouldn't drink and this and that fuck him he's no better than me he's just as bad in other ways I really hate it when all his friends come over here it's like fucking chinatown that's what my whole dorm is like just a bunch of asians and arabs except for the 00nd floor all the people on that floor seem to be white and that's where all the hot girls are I need to get on that floor I should have just lived in towers that would have been better. speaking of hot girls I wonder what stephanie is doing right now. I really should call her and try and hook up with her I can't tell if she is putting me off or if shit really keeps coming up that she has to do instead of going out with me but oh well that girl susan is really nice and she seems genuinely interested but it's hard to tell but she does have really nice tits why did I just write that whoever is grading this is going to think that I am just a perverted moron but that's not true I don't know why people think that about me but it really pisses me off in fact nothing pisses me off more than when people think I am stupid, especially when I am smarter than that person that really sucks that vinny testaverde is out for the season the jets are going to suck this year and I can't believe that the cowboys won today that was just unbelievable. I wonder if my pledge brothers were watching the game I really hate my pledge brother PROPNAME that guy seems so shady if he's not acting like a greedy little son of a bitch he's acting like a fucking tool that should be PROPNAME's new nickname, tool. oh well its been 00 minutes and I am tired of doing this so no more words goodbye. \nAsnwer:"
