No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Ok so right now I am thinking of the order that I plan to do things tonight and what exactly I want to do. My friend from back home is coming into town so I want to do something fun, so she will have a good time. I decided not to pledge this semester though so I don't have any fraternity hook ups any more like I did this summer so I don't know what I am going to do. I will probably call my friend PROPNAME who plays baseball for ORGNAME, he will most likely know of something that is going on. I think writing like this is really weird, I mean it is hard to believe that I am actually going to turn this in as a paper to be graded for school. It feels strange like I am doing the total wrong thing but you did say that it was a completion grade so I guess I am going to be ok. I keep looking at the time though to see how much is left, it is not that this is hard, it is just really strange, I mean I feel like I am writing a letter to one of my friends, and I'm just typing as fast as I can and saying whatever comes to mind, (to my knowledge that was the assignment) but I am NOT writing to my friend, instead I am writing to a professor and I excpect to get an A!  Oh well I just hope this is not too good to be true, these writing assignments I mean, it is like this isn't really work it is just a chance to tighten up my typing skills and kinda write a journal of sorts. Ok so I just was thinking about how I need a 0. 0 this semester in order to make sure I get into The College of Business at LOCNAME, and how that is the reason I am taking all fairly difficult classes to prove myself. well here is the thing, I had a 0. 0 as a transfer student and they still didn'tlet me in! it was because I didn't have economics, but still I had 00 hrs in just one yr of college, that is more than a great deal of people have after 0 years, at the least it is a semester ahead of schedule. so what I was thinking is how bad I want to get into business school but that I wasn't studying anything at the moment and how I really hadn't spent all my time studying but I feel that I am up to par with all of my classes but that maybe if I really want to get in I should be studying at all times and never really having fun. I mean the thing is I have decided that if I make a 0. 0 and am still not admitted I don't care, because it obviously wasn't meant to be, but I should be if I try my hardest I will not care, now I know that the only way I will be able to have peace with myself for not getting into business school is if I am condident that I gave 000% effort to get in, and I am afraid that if I am not studying and if I go out ever I will be unsatisfied and feel like a failure if I do not get in. Plus I know that if I actually bust my ass and make a 0. 0 with my schedule, people will have to take notice. well I am having troube with the canturberry tales though, I mean I am good in english but I HATE old english and trying to understand it, so when I read the canturberry tales it is like I am physically reading the pages but about 00% of the time I don't know what I am reading. so I tried to find a translation into modern english, and I found out that on the professor's test it is all basicaly quotes from characters and you have to identify, well if I don't read the original text I will not recognize the quote. Then there is business calculus, basically I was a person who was always in the honors math classes because I was an honor student but I sucked in math, like I should have been in regular math, but know I wasn't so I basicaly glided through all of my highschool math classes with b's not learning anything, so now I have an espessially hard time doing complicated math because I don't know simple math, however I know I can do this because I took college algerbra last year and yes I did have to study and get tutoring help but I ended up with an A in the class. I suppose I will have to do the same in cal. well I am doing alright in my economics class at the moment although I am a little confused as to how to draw a supply and demand graph but I am not too worried about that. This class is something that I am really interested in and I enjoy it but the truth is I am a chapter behind in the reading, I have only read chapter 0. I guess when I get done typing this I could go read ch 0, but is the start of my 0 day weekend and man, I just want to hang out, I guess everybody does though and that is what seperates the people who just wish they had something and the people who go get what the want regardless of the sacrifice. Ok so have now been over 00 mins but this was actually kind of fun. I hope this is what you were looking for. good bye byron \nAsnwer:"
