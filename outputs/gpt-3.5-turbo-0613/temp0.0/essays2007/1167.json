I am eighteen years old, and well in four days will actually be nineteen. I cannot believe that I am in college. The past three weeks of classes have been very overwhelming. I did not really know what to expect, and well I still don't know. After the first two days of classes I called home crying because I did not now how exactly to study for classes even if I did not have homework or a test the following day. I am kind of getting into the swing of things. Last night my ex boyfriend called which really surprised I me. He wasn't really my boyfriend but we were for sure dating. About a week and a half ago I found out that he was dating another girl at the same time that he was dating me. I was really upset when I found out but for some reason I never cried. I usually cry over the littlest things but this time I didn't. It's not that I wasn't upset but I think that I was trying to be a stronger person. Anyways, back to the point, I can't believe that he called. I am really excited because on Sunday I am going to meet my parents in LOCNAME LOCNAME to go to dinner for my birthday. My mom keeps asking me what I want for my birthday, but I don't really know. My friend PROPNAME just walked into my room. I told her to leave because I don't want to lose my train of thought. That is the problem with living in the dorm. People just walk in and out of my room and it is really hard to get things done. My roommate and I usually lock our door so no one can disturb us. Oh, about two and a half months ago I got a speeding ticket and I have to take defensive driving. I rented the defensive driving video from Blockbuster today. The video was so boring. I really miss my sister. She is so great to me. Last night I was thinking how weird, well it isn't really weird, but almost every time we get off the phone we say, \"I love you. \" It is not weird to me but I don't think that most brothers and sisters say I love you every time they get off of the phone. I don't know I guess I just think it is cool that we have such a close relationship between one another. I sometimes think what I would do if I lost her or didn't have a sister as great as her. Sometime she can be really rude to me but for the most part she is such a great sister. Speaking of great people, I love my parents so much. I have never really realized how much they really care about me and worry about me until I went off to college. The day that I called them crying they were so worried about me. I called them again that night and they were so relieved that I was feeling better. Also, yesterday I felt really sick and my told me that she wished that she could be here to take care of me. My family is probably the greatest thing that I have in my life. What I really wish for right now is to make at least a 0. 0 this first semester. I am going to try really hard. I know I can do it I just have to keep up with my studies and work really hard. So far I think I am doing good in studying. I am really trying to balance out study time and play time. I can't believe how much my mind switches from subject to subject. This is awesome. I have just typed so much in just twenty minutes. \nAsnwer:"
