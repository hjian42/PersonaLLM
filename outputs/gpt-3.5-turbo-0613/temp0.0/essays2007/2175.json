No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I'm wondering just what the point of this is. this is really boring,       I wish I had something to eat, it's getting close to dinner time, maybe      if I turn on the stereo this won't be so bad. it's really hot in my dorm room, this is still as boring as ever. I don't know how I'm going to     be able to keep this up for twenty minutes. I can't help but stare at the     posters to kill time. I'm particularly fond the print of PROPNAME's sunset at LOCNAME. There are so many things I'd rather be doing right now, like watching TV or sleeping. Well I'd much rather this have been a 0 minute stream of consciousness writing, since 0 minutes has lapsed. I wonder     just how many of these the professor/TA's actually read. I know I wouldn't want to have to read any of these. Hopefully I did well on my biology test I took today. Tomorrow is my birthday and hopefully that will be cool. I still have a lot of reading to do tonight, which I will more than likely put off until sunday. Only ten minutes has gone by so far. this is incredibly boring, but at least it's not all that difficult. I thought last class's discussion was very interesting, however gruesome some of the experiments on the mice seemed. I can hear people talking out side. Normally I would find this disruptive, but now it's welcomed as it helps me think of more to write about. I wish I had a laptop so that I could type this elsewhere, and I think the heat from my computer contributes to my room's excessively high temperature. I wish I could go to the game saturday, but I didn't get a ticket. Last week's game was really exciting. Only one more minute. I just wish this were over with. I can't help but notice how disorganized my desk is, even this early in the school year. I can hear music playing in the next room. I wish my stereo system was that loud. \nAsnwer:"
