MAN, that French class is really kicking my but right now!!  But, I'm determined to suck it up and get through it with a decent grade!!  I feel so insignificant compared to PROPNAME, he probably has no idea what it feels like to feel so behind everyone else!  But of coarse, I would never let on to that around him. I really can't wait till I finish this semester and maybe next semester I will have a better experience. I really think that 00 hrs for a freshman is a little too much, especially for me. I really feel like I cheated someone out of a spot well earned here at LOCNAME. I don't feel like I'm smart enough to be here. But I'm sure that I'm not the only person that had those thoughts every now and then. I really just hope I can keep a b avg so I can keep that scholarship!!!  I should probably make French a pass/fail class. I'm just so jealous of people that catch on to language so quickly and leave students like me in the dust!!  Ah. I should just be glad that I have the opportunity to explore myself here instead of griping about it 00/0. And MOM!!!  she can't keep her mouth shut. If I wanted PROPNAME to know I wasn't feeling very confident then I would have told him!!!!  But of coarse, he calls and says, \"mom said you couldn't handle your FR class. Well, just remember that school is your job!\"  I know JOHN!!!!!!!!!!!  he just doesn't understand that I have too much pride in me to admit that, yeah, I was crying to mom that I really didn't know if I could keep up in French!  I hate it when he sees that \"failing\" side of me. I want to be as invincible as he is. And that's impossible. I can't live up to his example!!  There's no way I'll graduate first in my class here at LOCNAME like he did and get some awesome job in new York that pays more money than I've ever seen at once!!!  It sux having a brother that had scholarships that paid all of his college expenses with money still left over!!!!!  He amazes me. Maybe that's my problem is I'm trying too hard and wasting all my energy to impress him!  Its not Mom, I know she just wants these years to be the best years of my life, but john wants them to be my JOB!!!!!!  What the hell!!!!  Can I not have a normal family that just is happy and supportive of me and understands that I am an individual that will do and accomplish different things than they ever did in different ways than they ever thought of!!!  Maybe ORGNAME's not for me. Maybe I'm meant to be at some rinkydink community college, where not that much is expected of me!!  But no. That's not me. There's just something in me that won't let me settle on average         \nAsnwer:"
