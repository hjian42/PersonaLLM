I have always wondered what makes the computer make that noise. it sounds like it is computing data or something. like it is processing stuff. I guess that is what it is doing but I am not really that for sure. there it goes again. it always does that. oh well. who knows. my name is PROPNAME and I am in psychology 000 with PROPNAME. so far I have enjoyed his lectures more than any other teacher. I am not for sure if it is because I find psychology interesting thus far or if he is just good and / or interesting in his way of presenting the material. Either way I enjoy going to psy. more than any other. somebody just made a loud noise from the kitchen. now they are getting ice out of the freezer. water sounds good. I am starving too. I wonder what we are having at the LOCNAME LOCNAME house for lunch today. it better be good. I am starving. I have had a bad headache all day too. I hope it goes away soon. it is probably just because I haven't eaten lunch yet. I t will probably go away when i0 eat. it usually does. tonight I have a lot of homework to do. Chemistry is keeping me very busy. I had no idea that Chem000 was going to have so much busy work involved. my muscles are sore today. I wonder if I will play catch with PROPNAME again today. it will probably be good for me if I do. it has been fun getting outside and doing stuff. the rain might keep us from doing it though. it has been raining just about everyday. I wonder when it will stop. it is supposed to be raining so much because of that storm down on the coast or whatever. I wonder of pres. PROPNAME is going to get impeached. that would be pretty crappy if he did, not that he doesn't deserve it. he should not have gotten with PROPNAME PROPNAME like he did. that was really stupid of him. I can't think of a dumber thing that he could of done. I bet PROPNAME is pissed. that has got to be embarrassing. the cowboys looked good yesterday from what I saw. that sucked that I had to do some homework during it and couldn't just enjoy the game. I wonder how long PROPNAME will be at he is supposed to be out for 0 to 0 weeks. I think that they will still do good without him though. it sucks that he is gone though, he is awesome. I never knew he went to ORGNAME until this weekend when they said it during the Horns v. ORGNAME game. I wish we would have won that game, but I really didn't expect us to. we played awesome in the second half. I hope that is caries over to the LOCNAME St. Game. if we would win that game it would be so large. I wonder if we are still going to be in the top 00 pole after this weekend. I hope so. we did look crappy during the first half of the game though. it will probably boot us out. PROPNAME did good, he better win the heisman. he is good enough to that is for sure. I wonder if all of my friends had fun in LOCNAME. while they were there for the game. I hope I get to go to LOCNAME. for some reason in the near future. I have never gotten to go there before. I think I get to go this summer with PROPNAME and her family if they still go. that would be fun. Mom and Dad head for LOCNAME in about 0 weeks or less. they are going to have a blast. I wish I could go, but is have to stay for school. ugh. that sucks. oh well, I want to go on a cruise sometime too. I think that would be the most fun. I can't even imagine how nice those big ships must be. I have seen pictures but that is all. I hope I can go on one of those one day. maybe for my honeymoon. who knows. \nAsnwer:"
