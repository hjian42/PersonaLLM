I have been coming to LOCNAME for football games as long as I can remember, but I always go home when they are over. This time I am staying and my family is going home. It's so hard for me to think I will be spending the next four years here. It's so big and full of so many people. The first day of class I didn't know what to think. I was so overwhelmed by it all. I decided to go through rush here at LOCNAME, and that was an experience all on it's own. It was a week full of stress, and aching feet. You are surrounded by a bunch of girls that are trying to out do the next and you can't really tell if people are being fake or themselves. I just hoped for the best and tried to have fun. Now that it is all over and I made my bid. I was relieved a little, but not enough. The day after rush ended classes begin. I had no time to relax or get things together. I was stressing out more than I had ever before. I didn't know where my classes were, I missed my friends and family, my roommate and I have been a little off, it seemed like nothing was going right. I really wanted to cry. It's so hard for me to think that I am not happy here because I can vividly recall not too long ago saying that I couldn't wait to get out of high school and get to college. I was so excited about moving to LOCNAME. I didn't think I would miss my family too much because they would be coming down for all the home football games. Boy, was I wrong. I told everyone that I wouldn't think of going home my first weekend of college, but as I sat in my dorm room last Friday thinking about all my friends going home for the holiday I don't think I could have packed up my stuff any quicker. I was so excited about going home. I couldn't wait to get there. Even though I did homework and laid around most of the weekend it was very nice to just relax and not have to worry about anything. There are so many things to do in Austin and even when you say your not going out, someone is always trying to talk you into going somewhere. My past week of college has been fun, but scary. I am not use to being so unorganized. I need a schedule and a daily routine, so I won't feel so strung out and frazzled. So many things have been going through my head, about college and how I feel about it and I can't exactly put it all into words. When people ask me about school I don't know what to tell them. I wish I could say I love it and I am having a blast, but I would be lying. I have had fun, but I am kind of scared and homesick and I feel like I am in a maze and I can't find my way out. I don't think I am making any sense. My feelings are just all jumbled up and I can't seem to sort through them. I need direction. I am hoping every week will get better and I will gradually find my way and start to feel at home here. \nAsnwer:"
