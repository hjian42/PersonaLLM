Usually when PROPNAME have to write something I like to introduce myself first. I did not prewrite this I promise. I was born November 00, 0000 (PROPNAME day before Thanksgiving). I am now 00 years old and am excited about being in the college ORGNAME engineering ORGNAME the ORGNAME PROPNAME ORGNAME at ORGNAME as a Biomedical engineering major. I love to play sports (volleyball, softball, and track), write poetry, praise dance! and enjoy nature. Some things that I would like to do before I leave LOCNAME or before I graduate college are to go horseback riding again (preferably, to take horseback riding lessons), to go kyacking ( I don't have a clue right now as to how to spell this word), to go parasailing with a friend of mine and to visit the capitol and some of the musuems in the city. I would also like to get involved in a good service organization. I love service and helping other people. Oh!  About my family. I am the PROPNAME of PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME of LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME. I have one older sister, PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME. My father works for a nuclear plant, my mother is a teachers aide, and my sister is in the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. She (my sister) has been overseas twice (yes, to LOCNAME as well--she said that where she was wasn't that bad at all). She has now been restationed to florida. This makes me really nervous sometimes because we are predicted to have a pretty bad hurricane season this year and many of them hit florida. She picked a bad state to go to. Anyway, I told my sister that she could go wherever she wanted as long as I could come and visit at least once (ha! Like I could really decide where she would go. I just thought I'd try it). She would have flown me to LOCNAME to go see the sites and to go see the pyramids in LOCNAME but my mom wouldn't let me go. She didn't want the both of us over there. However, I plan to go visit in LOCNAME either during Christmas break or Spring Break. My thoughts have now shifted to the PROPNAME family. This is a family or couple that I meet on a plane my eighth grade summer. I had gone to National Baptist Conference in LOCNAME and was flying back to houston by myself. They told my god-mother, who was with me before the flight, that they would keep an eye on me. When we got to houston we exchanged info and said we would keep in touch. Now, usually when this happens, people don't really keep in touch but in this case we have kept in touch for over 0 years now. We send each other cards, call each other and all that good stuff. I think that that is just amazing. What esle to talk about???? OK I am just getting words now. (Friends, other homework, love,Oh) Let me tell you about the home I would like. I was raised in a somewhat country area and I came seem to get awat from that. I would like to build a big country house with a large bay area window, sunlight roof in the kitchen or some area of the house, maybe a lake, and I know that I want horses, dogs, and cats. I don't know why but this picture always comes into my head when I think of what I want my future home to look like. Also I have to have a porch that goes all the way around with at least one swing on it and most definitely atleast one walk in closet. I don't know exactly where I would like this house but I think I would like it to be somewhere in LOCNAME. Time is almost up and this is about all that I can think of right now anyway so bye and I will see you next time. The one and only.   \nAsnwer:"
