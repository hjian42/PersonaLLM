I am listening to a PROPNAME PROPNAME's CD. I was never really a big fan of his until recently. My roommate and best friend ( she is also taking this class) loves PROPNAME PROPNAME. She asked me to go to his concert with her months in advance. I had heard a few of his songs, and even though I wasn't crazy about them, I agreed to go. It was two weeks before the concert and a really good friend of ours was moving to LOCNAME to go to graduate school. PROPNAME PROPNAME was going to be in LOCNAME on Friday and LOCNAME on Saturday. So PROPNAME ( my roommate) decided to sell her tickets and we would help PROPNAME move and see the concert in LOCNAME. On our way to LOCNAME the U-Haul had a blow out and a few other tragadies occured, forcing us to miss the concert. PROPNAME was devastaed. So Saturday we headed back to LOCNAME and bought tickets to go. After several beers we were there. Somehow I got seperated from my friends. When we found each other I cried, I think it was from the alchol. Anyways, we happened to be at the right place at the right time and a guy came up to us and brought us armbands to go to the front of the stage. I pushed my was to the very front and managed to convince a bodygaurd to give me a backstage pass. At the end of the show they took me backstage, gave me flowers and then showed me to PROPNAME. I was the only one that wasn't freaking out backstage, so he came up to me. We talked and he signed my ticket (the only thing I had on me). He left but came uback up to me five min later. I was talking to somebody and I saw soomeone come up besaide me. Then I felt a hand on my breast (the right one). It was PROPNAME, signing my chest. I thought I would faint. His voice is so sexy. Later right before he left, he came up to me and kissed me. I love him and will marry him one day.    Sorry I wasted ten min blabbing about the same story. I guess the point of the entry to to see how many ways my brain goes. I just thought of something else. I have a crush on a waiter that I work with. I'm a hostess. I haven't had a crucsh like this in a long time. I'm so mad because he didn't work today or yesterday and he won't work until Friday. I don't even know anything about him. That's probably why I like him. The last guy I dated was gay. He won't admit it but I know he is. We're not seeing each other anymore. I usually don't talk about guys this much, but for some reason they are on the brain tonight. I just set up my email account today. I'm soo excited. My parents have been bugging me to get one. I'm using a friends computer right now, but we will have the internet set up by Friday.  I really hope no one reads this horrible shit. I know it doesn't make any sense and no one cares about any of it. I have to go read 00 chapters for English now. Aren't you jealous??!!  \nAsnwer:"
