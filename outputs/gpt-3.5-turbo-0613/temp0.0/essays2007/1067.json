No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: There is drilling in the hall way which I find just irritating so much, I also find that I hate computers and I shouldn't have been born in this time period, but yet again all the technology I have now I can't live without. But I do find that man and woman both are getting lazier and lazier, we are all looking for a short cut to everything, I saw on a commercial that you don't have to scrub your toilet anymore because they invented some cool thing you can spray right into your toilet and poof all the yucky grime that forms around the toilet disappears. Also they got that fresh shower thing so you don't have to clean your shower anymore at all. So if you don't want to go out and drive to the grocery store you can go on line and order your groceries. I remember once this PROPNAME's ORGNAME truck fill with some lazy person's grocery came by our house looking for directions to someone's house. I found how funny it was that people are willing to pay people to grocery shop for them. Grocery shopping to me is one of the most easiest things in the world and I rather enjoy it. Lazy people! See this was why ORGNAME. com was going up 00 points a day two years ago. Thanks to lazy people, amazon. com stockholders were rich, but now amazon died down a bit. Ok I did shop at amazon. com once, I'm not a big fan of sending out my credit card number across cyber space, I just don't feel safe, it's that insecurity paranoia I have. But I guess shopping online is sort of fun. But I feel that things are getting much more easier and I'm getting much lazier. I come to ORGNAME and everything is like technologized if that is such a word, but I mean I can pay may bills online! and register my classes online, and heck you got a website to make my life easier. I'm for extra help, but to mean all the stuff to make my life easier is bumming me out, I wonder if I am as smart without the technology because it's like the other people living way before or going to school at LOCNAME before all the new tech stuff was offered to them. I mean every student almost has to have an email account, I still don't know how to get to mine at all. I'm so computer illiterate and I want to be a MIS major, isn't that an oxymoron. One day I know that I will have to eventually have to buckle down and start learning how to work a computer and not ask people to help me with it. I told my teacher once that if my computer ever breaks or my phone doesn't work I'll just hire someone to fix it, then he said to me, why don't you be the one that fixes things, some people make a living doing things that other people just rather hire people to do and they are making a fortune out of doing that. I didn't under stand that at the time it took me I think five years to figure out what he meant by it, then again I forgot what he said and then miraculously I remember what he said about some months ago and it made sense. It's weird that I have very few scattered memories about my childhood. I remember bits but never complete parts. It's more like images than anything mixed with sounds almost like a dream, damn drilling! sometimes I wonder if my early memories are actually dreams I had and I couldn't distinguish the two. Sometimes I have these dreams that feel so real and sometimes I have these dreams where I know that it's really a dream it's so weird. I wonder is coma people dream about when they are in a coma, do they dream at all, I know that this could be answered if I were to research it but I'm lazy, and I'm sure that if I do some exploring on the internet I could find a website that is dedicated to answering this question. \nAsnwer:"
