No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: today was a pretty lousy start. last night matt and I talked about alchoholfor  about two hours. he needs lots of help. God is the only one who can really  change his life. its hard for him to let go and put his life in the hands of  another . samehere. can't tellif jamie is getting bothersome . I'm so tired , life  is like inthe evening. such a traitor ,momentsof light. haze followed by  enlightenment . God speaks, I listen, but still no work is done. How will I  ever get out of this slump? there seems to be no ethical -work movement in  possible future. so tired eyes heavy with disgust and empty anti-thought. supposed philosophy is taking the place of construct.

I need a phonecall. maybe I should buy a  new car. And I wish it was a big world because I'm lonely for the small town id  like to drive and not look back . blow my money at a casino in seattle if one  existed. then id sit in the rain all day and eat salami sandwiches . meat the  woman of my dreams at a dance who is almost as depresed as I think I am. she'd  see right through me and I through her. then Id move to mexico and start a church   then move back to texas and live on a ranch . then move back to austin an start  a rock and  roll band with major influences from Ro \nAsnwer:"
