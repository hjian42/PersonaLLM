No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Trying to decide what to eat for dinner is complicated, especially when people don't answer the question. When you ask someone \"What do you want to eat?\" most likely they will say, \"I don't know what do you want?\" Well, if I did know what I wanted to eat, I wouldn't have asked you. It is a simple question with a simple answer. Right now I just asked my boyfriend what he wanted for dinner and his response was, \"I don't know whatever you want\". Well, that's why I asked you, I don't know what I want to eat, that's why I asked you. I guess that I wanted him to make the decision for me. I honestly don't know what I want to eat. It's a simple question and it's up to my stomach and brain to make that decision, but I'm asking someone to make this important decision for me. Does this mean that I'm lazy because I want someone else to make a decision that I can only make for myself. Maybe I'm not lazy; maybe it's just I want someone to help me make that decision. That seems logical, a person can't be lazy simply because he or she doesn't want to make a decision for themselves. \nAsnwer:"
