No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: My thoughts I have never tried to write about my thoughts before, so here goes: I'm sitting in my dorm room just where it is quite hot for some reason even though the air conditioning is set for the coldest setting, oh well, I guess PROPNAME isn't perfect. My suitemate sure isn't any good. I hadn't seen him for the last two weeks, but as soon as I put a TV in the living room, he shows up. Lousy moocher. Now I have to listen to my headphones because he is watching some stupid movie. These things make my head hurt, and I don't like the music I'm listening to, stupid Backstreet Boys. My girlfriend loves them, I sure do miss her. She lives in LOCNAME and goes to ORGNAME, she is so nice. She isn't anything like the other girls I know, she never complains, and always does whatever I want to. I'm lucky to have her. I'm afraid that this long distance relationship thing won't work out. That would suck, I don't know what I would do. My head just hurts thinking about it, or is it just these tight headphones. They aren't even mine, they are my roommate's. He is a great guy, one of my best friends from LOCNAME. He just got back from his girlfriend's dorm room. She lives upstairs, and that isn't fair. He gets to see her all the time, I only get to see my girlfriend every two weeks or so. I guess that could be good too since I need to study a lot. I have some big shoes to fill, both my brother and sister went to ORGNAME and they were both in the business school, which I couldn't get into. Sometimes I feel stupid compared to the two of them. My parents really want me to do well, and I hope I can make them happy. If I try really hard, and get a little lucky, I might be able to transfer into the business school. That would be cool. I feel sorry for my mom, and I am scared. She needs a liver transplant, and it isn't fair for her. She wasn't a drinker or anything, she lived a very good life. She just happened to have a bad liver. That's why I hate PROPNAME PROPNAME. One day a friend of mine was talking about how we should give free health care to everybody, but I totally disagreed. I told him that we shouldn't help the drunks and druggies, and he thought I was crazy. That's when I get really pissed and started yelling about how stupid celebrities like PROPNAME PROPNAME get to skip people on the transplant list, get a new liver and then drink through it. After that they get to take another one, then he died anyway, that is the only thing that made me happy. They could have given that liver to my mom, rather than some stupid lush who just killed it. Someone told me that he had a disease that he couldn't stop drinking, I say BS. He could have paid someone to walk around with him to make sure he didn't drink any alcohol, but my mom can't do that. She just has bad blood, if we could pay someone a hundred thousand dollars a month to follow her around and keep her healthy, we would do it in a heartbeat. We don't have that option. Well that's twenty minutes, I don't know if that was exactly what you were looking for, but that is pretty much what I was thinking, and that was pretty fun! \nAsnwer:"
