Actually I don't want to do homework at all. I don't like reading textbooks and that is all we have been doing. I actually didn't even start reading any of my books until I knew I had to for an Economics quiz. This weekend the plan was to catch up on everything and I really didn't. I did catch up on economics, which is the hardest class I'm taking. I am really disappointed that I didn't get to see my friends in LOCNAME, but I did get to hang out with my parents and that was nice. I miss them but I love college and LOCNAME. I also hope that I get to hang out with my cousin more and get to know her a lot better. Unfortunately our age difference is huge so we don't have too much in common but she has been calling and cooking for me so I don't mind that. Cat's here and she's talking. PROPNAME is here and she's messing with channels. Earlier we watched the U. S Open after she got home and we watched PROPNAME PROPNAME lose. Yay. Oh, I really have to sneeze and I'm kind of thirsty. I really want to eat some peanut butter and crackers and maybe a taco. One time our fridge was leaking stuff that looked like coke. Today I talked to PROPNAME's mom more that I talked to her. I actually didn't get to talk to her because her voicemail turned on. I hope she is doing ok at ORGNAME because she hasn't sound happy or upbeat when I have talked to her. I talked to PROPNAME today too and now I'm so frazzled and distracted. Cat and PROPNAME are loud and I can't even complete a train of thought. It's kind of scary if a guy has a blow-dryer. Is PROPNAME PROPNAME the dean? I don't know but I'm so excited about UT. PROPNAME has a lot of clothes, food, and books and I think my dorm room is going to be vacuumed up by her stuff. Today I bought milk, actually my mom bought milk, and then we drove to PROPNAME. Later, I tried to put a fitted sheet onto my bed and it took a long time to put on and PROPNAME made fun of me because I couldn't put it on. I just told Cat that she couldn't have a Kleenex and it was pretty funny. I really like college and all the people I have met so far. They are so nice and I love them.  \nAsnwer:"
