No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: It is 0:00pm and I have decided to use my break between classes to tackle this writing assignment. I am not even in my dorm because my we ordered my computer and it hasn't come in yet. I am typing this from my friend's computer. She lives two doors down from me at the LOCNAME LOCNAME. Life is a really funny thing because it is so unpredictable. For example, three weeks before school started I was in a really bad car wreck. In the accident I broke my patella from the impact of my knee crashing against the dash. I have been in a brace to immobilize my knee and crutches ever since. So now I have to crutch around campus. it's terrible. I am having a really hard time writing this paper because there are no rules or criteria. I absolutely hate having no outline, it drives me crazy. I am the kind of person that needs very specific and detailed guidelines. Otherwise I panic because I not sure if I am doing is exactly what is expected. My classes so far seem really fun. All of my professors are really interesting and down to earth. My one concern is on Monday because I have two classes back to back that are on opposite sides of campus. I can't believe that I am on my own. My parents have been such a major part of my life because of snow skiing injury. My freshman year of high school I hit a tree while skiing and broke my femur. The brake went through my growth plate so I had major complications. I was completely dependent on my parents for everything. I couldn't walk, carry things, or even sleep through the nights. I've had 0 surgeries on my leg and I have been homebound from school for half of a semester. When I was homebound I had so much time to think about anything and everything. The main thing that I concentrated on when I was home was learning how to roll with the punches. I am an extreme perfectionist, which makes me very uptight about every little detail. Most people would assume that it is a good quality to be a perfectionist, but I beg to differ. A perfectionist gets so overwhelmed by the tiny mistakes that he forgets to look at the big picture. As a perfectionist your job is never finished because there is always something that could be improved. It's a terrible quality, it really is. My roommate is not really a perfectionist, but she is a neat freak so that is good. I am so lucky that I got paired up with such an awesome roommate. Her name is PROPNAME, and I love her to death. Its almost like we are the same person. We hit it off right from the start. What I like about college is that you aren't penalized for being yourself. In high school I was often accused of being fake. Sorry that I am a really friendly girl and I try to get along with everybody. College is such a big step in life, I feel like I am starting a new life almost. My three fiends from home are going to school here and they have an apartment at Melrose. I feel like they are my family now. They are three really great guys that I graduated with. I make sure their house stays clean and their schoolwork is taken care of. In return they make sure I am taking care of my knee and that I don't get too stressed out. It is such a warm feeling to know that someone cares about you. I think it is so important to show someone that you love them everyday, and to know that you are loved everyday. I was raised in a very affectionate family so that is what I am used to and what I need to get me through each day. Well the timer just went off, twenty minutes is up. I look forward to a great semester with you. \nAsnwer:"
