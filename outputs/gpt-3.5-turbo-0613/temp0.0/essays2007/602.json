The drive back here from home, just wore me out completely, and that is why I didn't have any time earlier to do my homework. I still need to take a shower. Then I have to wake up early in the morning and figure out where my biology discussion class is, so I can go in there and take the dumb quiz that the TA gives out. Too bad, I am going to fail it. The lectures my prof. gives, just don't really make since. I wish that my best friend PROPNAME and I could've spent more time together when I was home this past weekend. I also wish that my boyfriend PROPNAME would send me an email. I wish that we could somehow get passed this stupid problem we are having. It's hard enough him being in LOCNAME, then he has to go and get some weird attitude and get mad and not be himself. It is really making me mad, and sad all at once. I wish that I could see him, and knock some since into his head and then everything would be okay. PROPNAME is the only one that knows enough about us for me to talk to about our relationship problems. But I hate boring her to death with it, I don't want to get on her nerves about it. This past summer, everything was fine, and now it is all so different, I hate it. But there is nothing I can do about it. And then there is Matt which just gets on my nerves. He is my good friend from the past year, although we've known each other for going on 0 years. He just aggravates me, the way he is so scatter brained. I just get so frustrated, and tired of it. Poor guy, I feel sorry for him. Then, my mind always, swings back to PROPNAME. I can't ever not think about us, and this problem we are having. I so need to talk to him about it because I can't function unless everything is resolved. And it is driving me absolutely CRAZY. But he won't talk about it, he won't talk to me. And I am not the kind of person that can just drop it. I can't just say, oh well, and then forget about it. I have it on me for quite a long while. Every day, I see or hear at least 00 things that remind me of him or us together. Its so depressing. I hate being this way, all depressed and not my peppy, cheerful self. Well, I see that the 00 minutes are up now. SO long. \nAsnwer:"
