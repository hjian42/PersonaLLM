He's eating cereal. Sometimes I am jealous of this, because he  has his own place with a kitchen and food and everything. Even  PROPNAME has his own place with a kitchen and everything. Someday  I will have these things for myself. My own life, with my own things. Like in Days of Our Lives. There will be days of my life when I  do what I want, with whomever I choose. Until then I must continue  doing things their way . Everyone else\u2019s way, like my mom. My nose  itches. It is a very natural thing to scratch an itch, or itch a  scratch?  It is very annoying to itch. When I got sunburned, I  itched extremely badly. PROPNAME laughed at me because I was jumping  around in discomfort. I never want to feel like that again. Sunburns suck. I miss PROPNAME though. Even though I did not see her  much, I always knew she was just down the street. But things are  different now. That made it sad for me to leave. The fact that  she isn't down the street anymore. That was like a security for me. Just knowing. I am in a hurry to finish this assignment. I have to be in class in about half an hour, and I am nowhere close to where I need to be. Life can make you feel like that. Like you are never at the right point, where you need to be. Everything in never alright. That's and oxy-moron. Things don't  work that way. But things do tend to work themselves out. You just  have to keep moving to get through the bad stuff. I always want  something better. I feel like I am always in transit. It's had for  me to be happy with the present. At least I can let go of the past, now. That was an accomplishment for me, not to dwell on memories anymore. Still, I look forward to, and fear the future. I do know things are good  now. I am on my own, a little bit. I don't want to rush things. I am in no hurry to grow up. Well, not a big hurry at least. I do want the rest of my life to come. I want to marry PROPNAME, have  a house, and pets. I am going to have a rabbit. Maybe two. Kids  eventually, but not for a long while. The television is such a distraction!  I can get side tracked forever. I like how it takes me out of this life. It is definitely  an escape. \nAsnwer:"
