    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: what am i thinking? that is quesiton i sometimes ask myself when i'm things that are out of this world. thinking, to put the mind to work and have conversations in your head about whatever is on your mind at that moment or to ponder over a serious of questions or question such as this one. right, now i'm thinking of what to write, and as always not being able to think of anything worth writing. its not my thing to write out of the blue without having prethought what i was going to write. I'm sitting in front of my computer, cold and tired from a very long day. my dorm room is always to cold so i have to sit here shivering while i type. the cold may be affecting my train of thought since i'm preoccupied in thinking how i'm going to keep warm after this is over. i should have put on a sweater but for some reason i let myself remain cold and keep complaining about it. it's my fault really,i should just get up and put on a sweater or wrap a blaket around me. what stops me from doing it, i don't know. it could be because i have to stay here for twenty minutes typing or because i'm to lazy to actually get up and search for something warmer, or it could be because it won't be long after i put in on that i will have to take it off to go to sleep. i never found it comfortable to sleep with a sweater on, except of course in the extreme cases like when i used to go camping out in the mountains in the middle of january. i like camping, its the one thing that i love to hate and vice versa. during the day it nice to going hiking and stuff but during the night it can be horrible having to take a bath in the freezing cold and make dinner by fire and lamplight, not to mention the cold hard ground and the paper thin tents that are suppose to protect us from the 00 degree weather. i'm don't really like the cold but then again when its a hundred degrees outside i wish winter would come. people in general are never content with the weather. its either to hot or to cold,like food almost. we blow on soup to cool it down and hold ice cream in our mouths till it melts before swallowing it. my radio is on and so is the tv which has nothing to do with anything but we are suppose to write continuously for twenty minutes, so i thought i'd write that. its relaxing to be listenting to the radio, cause even when i'm down there's alway a song to cheer me up. right now i'm relaxed happy to be ahead in my reading but aware of a test i will have to take this friday. people always have the ablity to walk in at the wrong times. someone just knocked on the door and i shouted to them to come in and in seeing me at work they left but they did disrupt me which of course is always inviting except when i have to do something where i can't be interrupted like this timed writing. in 00 seconds, never mind i'm done. \nAsnwer:"
