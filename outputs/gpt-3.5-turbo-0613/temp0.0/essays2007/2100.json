No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: My feelings and thoughts about everything in general are very complicORGNAMEed or confusing. I have thoughts ORGNAME school work which seems to be very normal as being a freshman in this huge world. I feel lost sometimes, not in school but in general. Lost as in a sense do I belong in this society or will I make a difference in the world?  I feel betrayed from lovers and friends. I feel loved my family members but also frightened that I will not make them proud. I have done everything I can to be the person that I can be and I am scared that they will not accept me for. I feel that I have lived their life and they are pushing me to become what they didn't. I feel hurt and I wish that they would just let me go and be just me\". I feel that they are holding me back from the rest of the world. Why won't they just let me survive by myself? Why do they continuously brand me as this little girl who will never do anything wrong?  I think that it is all out of love but I am scared that if they keep this up that I will not want to go back to them and live life on my own. Smells that I have come across are well just the typical smells. Food, sweat, laundry on the way to my room, and sweet smells of different types of perfumes, detergent, soap, and whatever else people have. Inner smells I have come across are aromas of hard work and dedication. I see people and how they react to things. I see their facial expressions and I realize that they are human to. I can smell the fear or excitement in them. I can sense the fragility or strengths in them. I can smell a sense of belonging and acceptance. As I walk every day around campus and I look back on my life, I realize that I have worked up to this level and I am satisfied with my self. I look at the upper classmen and I realize that soon I will be in their place. I will be the head of the school holding a torch as the new students arrive setting a path for them to follow. I will be a leader and a part of the legend of the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. I will be a hero in accomplishing the difficult and the easy. I will be a survivor. I also think about life in general. I thank the LORD every night that I am alive and experiencing this great joy. I can hear my parents approval and my family's cry for love and if they could only be here while I live the life of a college student starting fresh in this huge society. I thank GOD every day that I have parents and a family that support me and back me up in everything that I do and that I will do. I thank GOD for my friends that accept me for who I am and that they will not change for me or anyone else. I thank GOD for the will power and the confidence that I am able to hold my head up proud and strong. I thank HIM for the love and affection of others. I thank HIM for the ability to be able to be myself. To have a life of my own and the free will to make decisions. I tell myself that I am lucky to be in the place I am in. I thank him for allowing me to make the right choices along the way leading me in this direction and that I may be able to stay in this direction. I thank HIM for keeping me healthy and alive. I think that I am a person full of faith and serenity. I am person full of heart and love. Like my name means, I am a person of \"STRENGTH\". I find it funny because I am a person that stands exactly 0 feet and I am tiny. But inside I am full of life and energy. I am strong in nature and in love. I am strong on the inside as well as the outside. I was brought up to be strong in the mind as well as in the body. I am a warrior of many things and I am a survivor like I said before. I am a lady, a friend, an athlete, a motivator, as well as a person of high standards. I am not anyone else nor do I desire to be. I am who I am and I am proud of that. I am many things but most of all I am \"ME\". \nAsnwer:"
