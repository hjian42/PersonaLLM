I wonder if this thing has, I hate these stupid pop ups, spell check. I just woke up, feel pretty worthless. Saw PROPNAME PROPNAME played to the Wizard of Oz last night pretty cool probably cooler if I was stoned. Only been stoned once before, didn't like it, no desire to do it again. I'm a beer girl. Need to work out, clothes don't fit as well as they use to. PROPNAME won't like that. I'm glad PROPNAME is coming this weekend I hope she has fun. I really miss my family, I hope my sister can can, Fuck these pop ups, come up next weekend for ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I don't know where anyone went, they're probably eating lunch. Damn, 00 more minutes, I don't really know what else to write about, maybe or is maybe if I turn on some music. This is one of my favorite songs, I like it better than the original, I think it was remade for Good Will Hunting, it makes me feel so. I don't know, introspective. Bad word, but can't think of anything else. I love words, probably the only reason I did well on the SAT. Damn I'm still so tired, don't know why, must have slept for at least twelve hours. I think I might be getting sick. Spring break best vacation of my whole life, some of my favorite memories. Memories are an odd thing. I wonder why you remember the things you do. Walked into the ORGNAME building the other day and the smell of it-deja vu-it was such an odd feeling, and I can't quite pin point what it reminded me of. I wish I knew. LOCNAME vu is such a weird thing I knew more about it- what triggers it and everything, maybe some day. \nAsnwer:"
