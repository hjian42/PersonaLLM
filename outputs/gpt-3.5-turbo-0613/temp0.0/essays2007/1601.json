I have a Calculus II T. A. session at 0 am. then comes a three hour gap before my next T. A. session, which is for biology 000. (I have just returned from that class) The T. A. started the class saying that for most people this class will be easy. By the end of the session he was telling us that the class will be quite difficult. I was quite amused by this irony. After the previous statement i took a quiz over chapter one that i had studied quite a bit for so i am quite confident that i did well. There were, however, a few challenging questions that i answered correctly. My next class will be psychology 000. The class is interesting, but i'm not sure i would be taking it if it wasn't a degree requirement. However, after reading parts of the text, i DO feel intrigued by the amount of information available through pyschology.     In my dorm room, i have a clock that has a quartz timer. so it makes a rather loud clicking noise every second. Having a background in music, i tend to want to move (tap my foot or snap my fingers) along with the ceaseless clicking of the clock. This poses a problem when i am trying to fall asleep. I have trouble falling asleep everynight because i can't stop thinking. I seem to be unable to quite down my mind. Eventually i do fall asleep and have to wake up SO early for my 0 am classes monday through thursday.     Last night i did laundary for the very first time completely on my own. I was anxious not having my mother right around the corner to ask if this shirt was for the light or dark load. While i was in the laundromat a few people had used WAY too much detergent and the window into their washing machine was FILLED with bubbles!  One of the guys there tried to justify it by saying that some of his clothes had stains on them and he thought adding more detergent would help aleviate the stains. On the contrary, i think it was his first time EVER doing his own laundary. It was quite a humorous situation. My clothes miraculously came out of the dryer unmamed and very clean. I was happy that the first time went on without any hinderences.     I am currently worried for one of my closest friends back in LOCNAME. Her name's PROPNAME and i think she is a wonderul girl and a phenomenal person. She is an only child and so her parent push her very hard to achieve good grades and such in school. She has a B at the progress report time and her parents have grounded her until she pulls her grades up. I keep her close to my heart through prayer and i also have pictures of her on my wall to keep my company when i am lonely. I can't wait until she comes to college and i can hang out with her more often.   Many of my friends party often. Not necessarily drinking all the time, but they often do drink. I have yet to go to a party in the university. I hear about date rapes and terrible things like that which frighten me, so i try to stray from any parties like those. My roommate is a member of the Christians on Campus here at the university and i attended one of their meetings (welcome dinners). I must admit that at first i felt very welcome to the organization. I told a few of my close friends back in LOCNAME that i was becoming involved in that organization. However, they told me that they had heard it was a cultish organization and that i should not become involved in such an organization. I looked up some literature about the organization and i was quite worried about being involved in such an organization.     I took a quick nap today between my 0 am and 00 pm classes. Right now there are fire inspections going on at the dorm. I  usually don't dream at all, but i did dream during this nap. I dreamnt that on three different occasions the fire inspectors came to PROPNAME's and my dorm room. On each occasion they found a violations (of course none of these existed, but were all fabrications of my dreams).  \nAsnwer:"
