Aw, why did that song have to end, it was good. the AC is really loud. Man, I like shrek 0. tonight, I'm breaking the habit tonight, I like PROPNAME PROPNAME, she's so talented. man, I'm so bad at spelling. I haven't heard this, oh, yeah, it's by clay aiken, or maybe it isn't. Oh well. ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. It was probably from LOCNAME LOCNAME, I'm from LOCNAME about thirty miles north of LOCNAME. I saw PROPNAME a couple days ago. She's got curly hair. Movie Night, um I don't know. I'm supposed to by typing what I am thinking. I'm talking with PROPNAME my roommate. She is wearing a hat. I have a hat just like it. It's in my closet on top on a shelf. PROPNAME is leaving now. I shall say bye to her. Ok, now that that is over. I am going out to lunch with this girl from Christians on Campus. Sounds like it would be fun. Her name is PROPNAME and she just graduated, I think from this college in LOCNAME but she is here for just the semester. Only 0 minutes have gone by. Wow, this is taking forever. I have chemistry oops, mistake. I don't like commercials on the radio, why couldn't they just play music commercial free. My folder is blue. I finished all my psychology reading (all of chapter three). I learned way too much info on the nervous system. It is going to take forever to study for the test. I'm glad there is a lot of info in the chapter though, because I'm going to med school and will need that info. I keep making typos probably because I'm typing too fast. Oh, I have ice-cream in the freezer. Mmmm. It is a blue bell ice cream sandwich. I like ORGNAME's. Ah, yay, another commercial free hour of music. YAY. I like PROPNAME PROPNAME. My Happy Ending is a good song. Everyone criticizes her for not being \"punk enough. \"  I laugh at how much time people spend criticizing artists. They should just appreciate the music. I think by saying that I was being a hypocrite because I was criticizing the people who criticize. Does admitting that you are a hypocrite make you a hypocrite. Deep, huh?  I'm wearing contacts. I like my sunglasses. They are on top of my head because it is pointless to wear contacts indoors. Wow, I am only have way done. Hey, maybe that means I'm optimistic. I am such a bad speller. I spend way to much time thinking about school. I'm such a nerd. Everyone else goes out and parties and I stay in the dorm and study for hours and hours. But I do tend to watch a lot of TV, wait, I haven't been watching much TV during this past week at LOCNAME. Only about 0 hour per day. I'm so proud of myself. I can't believe that I haven't procrastinated this assignment. I don't like this trend of girls wearing too short skirts. I guess I'm just too conservative and wear long jeans or caprice. I bought new caprice. My mom just washed them. I went to the B. E. S. T. thing sponsored by the business school. It was so much fun. We went to the lake. Hello, PROPNAME wrote me a note. My printer is off. I can't think of anything else to write about. I was valedictorian, I was nervous when I said my speech. YAY for 0. 0 ORGNAME. For having such a high ORGNAME, you would think that I wouldn't be so scatterbrained. I think it is just because it will take me a little while to get used to the whole college experience thing. I have to sign up to do that psychology experiment. I want to do the prescreening. PROPNAME says that it takes two hours. I want to get it over with and not procrastinate. I have that awful habit and am trying to get rid of it. I like this song, and that song, well, maybe not. I want to go so sleep. I went to sleep early last night 0:00. Oh, this is that singer PROPNAME PROPNAME (I am such a bad speller). I liked Spiderman 0. I have always been a fan of stuff like that: Spiderman, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, etc. I like Smallville on the ORGNAME. It is a good show. What else. I can't think of anything else. Ok, I have about 0 and a half minutes left. What else should I do. I have chemistry in an hour but I should leave in 0/0 an hour because I want to get a good seat in class. I'm so blind, even with my contacts. I don't want to sit in the very front row because then I will strain my neck having to look straight up at the Professor. I have Professor Laude. He is very funny. I went to a discussion session at 00. Wait, it was at 00 and ended at 00AM. I think is was fairly productive. I'm a business major. Did I mention that. I'm also pre-med. I want to be an pediatric ophthalmologist. That is just a fancy term for a kid eye doctor. It will be able to be cool to say that though. My mom was a doctor. My dad has a PhD, so he is in a sense a doctor. He is asst. Dean of the ORGNAME ORGNAME at ORGNAME. I like this song. It is by Maroon 0. PROPNAME, my older brother, he is 00, I think, likes this song. He has this CD and will never let me borrow it. He called me last night and was  \nAsnwer:"
