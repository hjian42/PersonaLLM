No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I returned to LOCNAME Monday night at about 00:00 a. m. thinking I would be able to simply crawl into bed. Wrong. Upon opening the door to my room I was mugged by an extremely intoxicated friend. Her name was PROPNAME and the source of her angst was my best friend PROPNAME. They, as I am, are both from LOCNAME. They had broken up their one-year relationship two weeks before they were to leave for ORGNAME. Unfortunately, they both reside in the private dormitory The Castilian. Unfortunately only because there is an exorbadent amount of tension between them, and I being friends  with both of them, am forced into an awkward situation. PROPNAME declares she is \"so totally over PROPNAME\" and is willing to forgive, forget, and become friends. Simultaneously, she has been extra nice to me, extra offense to PROPNAME, and picked up a nasty habit - getting totally plastered every night she has been in LOCNAME. She has a lot of frustration with PROPNAME, and regardless of what she thinks, needs to find more positive ways of venting it. PROPNAME's feelings toward PROPNAME are fickle and skeptical. Sean addresses some  interesting questions PROPNAME is unable to answer. Such as, why all of a sudden do you want to  be \"friends\", what do expect from our friendship, and why did you suddenly latch onto PROPNAME as a friend. PROPNAME's motives remain unclear and yet she doesn't seem to want to  discuss any of the many issues at large. In turn, this makes the situation of the three of us living within 00 seconds of each other an awkward one. Am I to take a side? Most definitely not!!! I refuse! Yet how can I befriend both PROPNAME and Sean without functioning as a mediator. This is one of the many issues that trouble me and make the transition from ORGNAME ORGNAME to Huge UT ORGNAME life challenging. Thank you. \nAsnwer:"
