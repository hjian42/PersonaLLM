I am home for the weekend from my first half week of college. It feels like I have just been on vacation and am home now. Some of my friends wanted me to go dancing with them tonight, but I took some allergy medicine and I have no desire to dance. The medicine makes me so tired. My dad is very upset with my cat because while I have been away, she has gone to the bathroom on lots of his important papers. She only does that when she is upset about something. I guess she misses me. We used to have a cocker spaniel named lady, but we had to get her put to sleep a while back. She was a wonderful dog. I am bringing my fish back with me when I go back to LOCNAME tomorrow. That is the only kind of pet we can have in the dorm. I had to sell my horse before I left for college. I had had him for almost three years so it was really hard. I still haven't sold all of my equipment. I can never find enough time to go out to the barn and get it taken care of. Princess PROPNAME died in a car accident this morning. I really didn't think that all of that royal family stuff mattered to me, but I guess after hearing so much about her life in the last couple of years, we all feel like we have some connection with her. Anyway, I think it is really really sad. I especially feel so bad for her children. I was watching 00 Minutes on TV a little while ago and they showed a clip of the two boys on a fishing trip with their father. My brothers and I used to fish a lot with the family too. It is weird to think that my brothers are getting so old. One of them is 00 and the other one is almost 00. That is hard to believe. I just turned 00 on Friday. It was sort of nice to come home for my birthday where people actually care that it is my birthday. I am also glad I came home because that way, I can be sure that I keep in touch with my friends who are still in high school. I want to go to the homecoming football game at my high school. I am already getting excited about my ten year high school reunion. I think it will be so cool to see how much people have changed. I went to LOCNAME LOCNAME at the end of the summer and a girl that was in my group lived near where I used to live in LOCNAME. She told me that a girl I used to know in elementary and middle school was killed by some guy. It was so shocking and really sad. I mean, I didn't know the girl really well and it had been many years since I had seen her, but it still made me think about how things like that really can happen to anyone. My roommate at Towers is really cool. I am glad we get along. I was worried I might get some freak. I can just imagine that if I had to request a change of roommates how acquired that would be to see the old roommate around campus knowing that you had ditched them. Twenty minutes of writing is a lot longer than I thought it would be. I think I still have a few minutes left. I think we have some raccoons living under our house because you can hear them sometimes scurrying around. Sometimes they are really, really loud. We used to have a mouse in our house so we had the exterminator put out one of those little sticky trap things. Well, it caught the mouse, but then my cat tried to get the mouse so she ended up getting the trap stuck to her paw. It was in the middle of the night and I heard her running around the house like a freak. Finally I got up to see what was wrong and I took the trap off of her. The mouse appeared to be dead so I put it in a baggy but when I got up in the morning, I found out it was still alive so I tried putting it outside but it was too stunned to move so I put it in a little cage until it recovered its senses. It finally got better so I let it go. I had to let it go far away from my house though  because my mom was afraid it would come back in. My cat got lost for eleven days once when we lived in LOCNAME. It was so sad. I cried everyday until we finally found her again. I think my twenty minutes is up now. \nAsnwer:"
