She informed me that my x-girlfriend is now dating a new person. It makes me mad. I don't know why. I don't like her anymore. Oh, well, just forget it. I'm hot. maybe it has something to do with the recent news. I guess I just need to \"cool off\". I really like it here at LOCNAME. everybody is very nice. I\u2019m trying to think of what to type. I\u2019ve got this particular song in my head, and I can't get rid of it. it's aggravating. I\u2019m tired. I wish I could take a nap, but the dorms are to loud. wow, she's pretty. I wonder if she'll be my future wife. maybe, maybe not. I wonder if I should ask PROPNAME to dinner tonight. I can't think of a way to ask her without making it sound like a date. I fear being rejected. I guess that's what pisses me off about my x. she \"just friended\" me, but I think the real reason was never mentioned. I hope she rots in hell. Emily\u2019s really nice. she seems really mature. I almost consider her a big sister, but not really. she just acts like she could be. I\u2019m getting sick of jester food. it all tastes the same. like shit. she's attractive. every girl here is really pretty, with some exceptions of course. so far, it seems like college has been all play and no work, except for this of course. there's so many people here. sometimes it's overwhelming. so much diversity. and yet, so much organization. I really like the atmosphere. the game last night was a blast. I\u2019ve never had so much fun at a game. so much spirit and energy running through the air. being in the band is the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. it's taught me a lot. I think I\u2019ve grown up so to speak. the idea of a computer lab strikes me as funny. all these people here, right next to each other, but there's still a sense of privacy. no one ever seems to look at other people's work. so much organization in so much chaos. I like Macs better than PC\u2019s. I don't know why. they just appeal to me more. I wish I had a girlfriend. it's been a long time since I\u2019ve been with someone. I miss it. I like the fact that my parents live here. we don't always get along, but I think that if they lived in another state, or even another city, I wouldn't be doing half as well here. I like the security. it's nice not having to miss them. and to not be homesick. I wish I could stay here forever. I don't want to have to get a job. but, at the same time, I often feel bad that my parents have to pay for my education. I\u2019ve always been that way. I really love my family, I just don't know how to show it very well. I\u2019m ready to start doing more work in classes. they're starting to get boring. I wonder what's to become of PROPNAME. I\u2019ve always liked her, ever since high school. she lives so far away, LOCNAME. I\u2019d love to date her. maybe because while I was with her, I never got the chance. damn, I wish I had the opportunity now. girls are so pretty. why?  sometimes, they get in the way of more important things. sometimes I like the distraction, but sometimes it hurts me. I think I\u2019m going to do well here. no problem. I\u2019m very good at adaptation. I think my time's about up. \nAsnwer:"
