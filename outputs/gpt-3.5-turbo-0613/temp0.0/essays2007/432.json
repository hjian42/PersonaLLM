No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Why do we even have computers if they are  so slow and crappy and can't hold more than \"X\" number of people at a time. time. And why can't I put Chip Smart out of business. They sold us a computer that doesn't work worth a crap. We had to replace the sound card and the modem. modem. I am pretty ticked off right at the moment. I don't feel like writing this assignment. I had to buy First Aid 00 to get the new modem to work. It just started working after a long and horrid battle so I am not in the mood for battling for a space on the computer to finish this assignment. Why does this class have to be so complicated in lecture and textbook reading. I don't care about every method in psychology just give me a briefing. I hope you really aren't reading this, because I am in entirely too grumpy of a mood to write anything that makes sense. I can think of nothing else but the immense dislike I have for my computer. I should name it Lucifer. Let me tell you a little about myself. I just got married Aug. 0. Therefore I am thinking about my husband, especially because he just walked in the door of our apartment at LOCNAME LOCNAME here in LOCNAME. I miss my father. His birthday was 0-0 and I forgot!!!!!!!  I felt like crying all day. I miss my mother too. Her birthday is coming up in February. (0-0-00)  I truly don't know my father's age. He is older than my mom I know. They divorced when I was 0. After that I guess I lost count. I was adopted  here in LOCNAME at LOCNAME. I was extremely lucky, because I got the best 0 parents in the whole world!  I truly mean that. I love them. I also miss my brother. He is in the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME right now doing much better. He wants to start working on his career now. He had a hard time with a lot of things, but he sure is strong. He is 0 years younger than me and is learning disabled. He had a hard time in highschool, but let me tell you that when it comes to technical and architectural knowledge, talent and ability, he is awesome. This center will help him get a job at what he is good at and that he will enjoy. Well, as you can probably tell I love my family. More importantly I love God because He sent His son PROPNAME to die for my sins and because I accept Him, believe in Him, and in return I have given Him my life to use me for His glory. Time is up. \nAsnwer:"
