After this I am going to go for lunch, I am feeling so hungry. Don't know how I will be able to keep writing for 00 minutes, seems like a long time. Parents are coming on Thursday night, have to go and finish off the work on Friday, better remember to finish calling about the computers today. There are so many people using the labs. I can't wait to get my computer back. We had better finish buying all the things we need this weekend. The TV people will be coming on Saturday; I think we need to buy a video as well. I should call Nimay and PROPNAME and see how they are doing. I forgot to email PROPNAME again. Better call him. I mean mail him. Oh god, I am so tired, need to sleep some more. Good, there's a long weekend coming up. I am so happy I do not have class on Fridays. Oh, now I do, Sitar class. but then that is hardly class, it's more of fun than class. I hope he teaches something in the advance class that I can learn from. That Monday class was ridiculous, doing all the basics all over again! Just 0 minutes up. 00 more to keep writing. That guy looks familiar. Better finish off on all my work 0day and go study for that accounting quiz. It looks like it's going to be easy, if he does the kind of stuff he did in class yesterday, then it's going to B really easy. I hope I do well this semester, make the 0. 0 that I want to. Statistics and Psychology look like they are going to be hard; I hope I do well in both these classes. Winter break should be fun, am really looking forward to going back home. Going home is always nice; it's good that mom and Pop are coming this weekend. We should have a good time. We'll take all these people out to dinner; they'll like that to. PROPNAME's parents will be here as well. We should all go out together. We should go to that place we went to last time, it was really nice. I think we'll go to LOCNAME LOCNAME as well this weekend, will be fun. I hope the weather is nice. I wonder which car we'll be renting?? I hope we rent a nice car. we'll need a big car. I need to work out how I'm going to get to the airport. probably take a cab, the bus won't be running so late. I should check up the bus schedule as well, probably have to buy it. Better buy the book for that LOCNAME class, and the course packet as well. I'll ask PROPNAME and Twisha to buy it. they live at PROPNAME. I'll probably go to PROPNAME now, maybe buy it right away. Buy lunch there, probably go to their room and relax, I hope they are in their room. Otherwise I'll go to PROPNAME or Nimay's room and chill there for a while. Jeez there are so man people living at PROPNAME. So many Indians, and so many freshmen. I think Dobie is a good place for freshman to live. An apartment is better, but then not that great an idea for freshman. I think Senior year I might live at Dobie, only because it so close and convenient. Otherwise it isn't a really great place to live. Lets see what happens. all that is so far away. \nAsnwer:"
