I really enjoy all of my new classes but by math Professor is really hard to understand. I miss PROPNAME so much and ca not wait until this weekend when I get to see her. This typing stuff and I don't get along very well but that\u00d5s why I have voice activated word processor. I talk and it types everything that I pronounce. I really don't think that fifteen hours on the first semester of school was a very good idea. I have absolutely no free time. I have PHL, PSY and ORGNAME so I am reading all the time. At least I have a few good friends in most of my classes. I need to get my head back in school though because right now it is still in summer. All the information I receive in lectures simply goes in one ear and out the other. I hope my Mom is doing better. I left her alone all by herself when I moved to college. Wow, this is a really elementary level paragraph,   Ehh, O well.   So I wonder if its true that guys can blank out and be thinking about nothing, no literally nothing and girls always have thoughts flying through their heads. If it\u00d5s true the girls papers should be some what longer than the guys unless of course the girl cannot type very well (like me). I really wish I could decide on a major soon but if not I know everything will be just fine. The only thing I would like to have more of is free time. I have no free time to get my mind off of the books. Hopefully that will come soon. I\u00d5m getting pretty tired of riding the capital metro to and from school I really need to see about a dorm room for next semester but for sure next year. I feel like I am writing diary or something, actually it's quite relaxing and stress relieving. I need to see about going to my chem. and math's professor\u00d5s office hours. Well I\u00d5m thinking so hard on what to write about that I am drawing a blank, I think its the small amount of sleep I have been acquiring. I wonder if my cars AC will be fixed tomorrow like they said but then again they said it would be today and I'm still with out a car. It's very hard not to use   IM   language on this and abbreviate everything. By the way I suck at spelling so sorry if anyone reads this other than me. I wonder what all the goop is inside my lava lamp is made of?  I don't know but I do know that my Chem. professor wouldn't know because he have a hard enough time trying to teach my class of 000 the chemistry basics. Sweet it's already over, man that was fast, too bad it's not like that in class. \nAsnwer:"
