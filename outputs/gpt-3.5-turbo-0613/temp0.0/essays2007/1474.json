I am thinking about a guy/friend that I have. He is not being very honest with me. It seems like he is trying to trick me into thinking that he is a really nice guy, but I know better now. He is just going behind my back. He got this new girlfriend and we had been going out before and we had agreed to stay friends, which I thought was a really good idea. But now he is trying to leave me hints to his new girl, but he won't just come out and say anything. He is just being really dishonest. Now I am thinking about how bored all of the reader of this project. How you all may have a real problem and I am fixated on stupid stuff. I am sure you that whoever is reading this must thing I am a really big idiot. Well when it comes to problems I am. I can't ever seem to settle things without messing up. It is such a shame that I can be good at stupid things like science, but I can't seem to solve anything without being upset. I guess I am so worried about what the other person thinks that I just ignore the fact that I need to look out for myself too. You know I can't really understand why I need to reveal my thoughts to some complete stranger. I guess it isn't a bad idea because all of this is kept confidential, but it just seems like the people that I have been trusting have be really dishonest, and I am not just talking about the guy I mentioned above. There is a girl who I really got to know this summer, but she was also dishonest. Maybe I am just a really bad judge of character. This would be a lot easier if I could write it down. I wouldn't have to keep backspacing all the time. My fingers are already getting tired and I haven't really been typing that long. My roommates alarm keeps going off. Why doesn't she just get out of bed and make us both happy. I am really a happy person in general. I mean I have my problems just like everyone else, but I am usually pretty pleasant. I must sound like an idiot. Why the hell do I even care what you think? I am never going to really know who you are and you don't know who I am. I mean you have my name and all, but you don't know me. And you can't know me just thought a little writing assignment. I wonder what you guys are going to do with these. I can't really see how you could do a complete project or anything. I guess you all have some reason. You know, I think I should be told what this is for. I mean I am just typing and thinking and I really don't know what this is going to do. LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME Now my mind had drawn a complete blank. I mean I am always thinking; it is just that I am thinking about how there are so many more interesting things to think about. My typing skills have really improved since I have been in college. I mean I used to have to look at the keys, but now I don't; it is really nice. I wonder how that happened. I think that I always knew how to do it, I just didn't trust myself. I mean, it is still more comfortable if I look at the keys and I can go a lot faster, but I make more mistakes. I think that is because when I am not looking at the keys I am looking at the screen and I can see when I mess up. WOW! All of the statements I have made have been so profound. You would think that I would think about things a little more important. Hmmmmmm, like what I wonder. I could think about pollution or racial inequality. Maybe something like the deficit. The thing is I think more people are more concerned about them selves not the problems of the world. I bet the first thing that someone would write would be one of their problems. Ha Ha! Interestingly enough that is what I did. WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE GOING TO DO WITH THESE! I really want to know. I don' t know why it bothers me so much. I think I just need to relax or something. OK, it has been a little over 00 minutes. I am going to go eat something and watch some TV. I hope my brain interested you. \nAsnwer:"
