No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I woke up this morning and I'm thinking. \"Where am I?\"  And then I realize that I'm at ORGNAME. I was so upset last night because I left after class got out at  0:00. Then everything went wrong. The trolley cart fell off the steps and all of my stuff went crashing to the ground. I got in my car and the needle was  practically buried to the red empty sign so I stop to get gas, then I decide that I had better eat something because as soon as I get there everyone will be ready to go out and I will be starving as usual and afterward no one will want to stop and get poor little old me anything to eat. And boy was I right. PROPNAME says it will only take and hour to an hour and a half to get here. Yeah right. Try two and a half. Someone goes off and gives me the wrong directions that takes me all the way to LOCNAME!  I was so mad at myself because I finally make it here, but I don't have directions to PROPNAME's or PROPNAME's or their phone numbers. I found PROPNAME's and ORGNAME answered which was exactly what I didn't  want to happen. She bothers me. We used to be friends, but then I don't know what happened, it's like all of a sudden, the only thing that she  cared about was who she was around and how much she could be seen doing thins with PROPNAME and PROPNAME. But now that she's up here all by herself she sure decided that ORGNAME and PROPNAME and I were perfect people to be her friends AGAIN. I just don't know I mean that I don't like that I feel that way as far as the fact that she just gets on my nerves, but I don't like being mean. I will tell her how I feel, now, because she doesn't seem to have a problem being rude and snotty to me. I went to Audrey's and I wish I had a house like PROPNAME or an apartment like Audrey ORGNAME Ginger. It's nice and filled with a lot more space than my dorm, but then again I kind of like The Woo. LOCNAME and Raya are so  nice. They take care to notice if I'm upset about something and they talk to  me about it. It just doesn't make me feel any better to know that their mothers don't call them EVERY NIGHT AFTER NINE O'CLOCK JUST BECAUSE THEY JUST HAPPENED TO  GET ONE THOUSAND FREE MINUTES ON THEIR PORTABLE PHONE. It's not that I don't like my mother calling, but she calls all the time and tells me to go to bed of all things. Little did she know that I have stayed up until 0:oo every night since Monday, and last night we got home at 0:00 but didn't go to bed  until 0:00. I don't know what she is thinking because she actually could not believe that people stay up until all hours of the night studying. I had to  let her in on a little secret. All of those nights she thought I was asleep, I wasn't. \nAsnwer:"
