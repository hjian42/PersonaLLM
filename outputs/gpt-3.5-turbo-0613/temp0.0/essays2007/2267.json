I'm enjoying not having my roommate here. it is so nice to just do whatever without someone here talking and making noise and talking to everyone under the sun on the phone. that's what my roommate does. instead of going out like a normal college student she sits in the room and talks to her parents like a million times a day. I guess whatever floats her boat though so whatever. as long as we are ok with me going out and coming in whenever I want then we have no problems. last night was pretty fun. I went to sixth street for the first time and had my first legal clubbing experience. I kind of got hooked up with this guy that game with my friend so that was fine except he wasn't that good of a dancer because he couldn't keep up with my rhythm but it was fun anyways. the funnest was on Friday when me and PROPNAME went to the hitching post where the iron spikes were having their recruiting party. we drank and had lots of fun then we got to spend the night at this guys apartment that I met at camp LOCNAME. he was a counselor that I had spent the entire first morning talking to about just whatever. I really didn't think anything of it at the time because I thought it would be like off limits to have any kind of fling with the counselors so I kind of kept my distance. I e-mailed him once school got started just to see how everything was going and see if he still remembered me. he did, which was good. I was hoping he would. I think I kind of like him but I have no idea what he thinks about the whole situation so I'm not going to stress over because it is so not worth it. and plus he is the guy and I grew up in a place where the guy always made the first move so I'm not all about jumping in here with my opinion and try to get something started. maybe that's my problem. when I want something I tend to let it come to me and I just wait around till something happens. maybe I should go after the things I want. speaking of things that I want, I applied to be a LOCNAME lasso. I got a call back today saying that they wanted me to come in for an interview. I was so excited. I have wanted to join something like this ever since I got to campus. they do everything, from socials to community service. I heard about it from the guy that invited me to the iron spikes party this past Friday. he is an iron spike and he suggested I look into it because he thought I would enjoy it. and the lassos do social events and stuff with them so maybe I could be able to hang out with PROPNAME a little more but whatever about that. I really hope I get in to this because I really want to be apart of something and have those group of friends that are in the same position as me that I can always count on to be around for me to go out with and things like that. I have been recently hanging out with PROPNAME who is one of the girls I met at orientation. we do everything together and she just got into longhorn singers so that pretty much takes up all her social time now. that's why I want to get involved in something of my own so I wont have to sit around my room waiting for a time when she can do stuff with me. that's not what college is all about. its about having fun and enjoying yourself, not sitting around your room all day and only coming out for food or class like my roommate. she is trying to get involved though. she signed up for the rowing team so we'll see how that works out. it seems kind of weird to me but whatever floats her boat. I'm no one to judge. I have got the music on my computer going and the TV so there is all kinds of stuff to keep me occupied while I sit here and type for twenty minutes. I have like five minutes left so that's good because I'm kind of getting tired of typing. tomorrow me, PROPNAME, and her roommate sheik are going shopping at LOCNAME creek mall! I am very excited about that because I love to shop and I want some big sunglasses. I have seen lots around campus and I want some of my own. I really don't want anything else but u never know once you get going. I'm  a big shoe fanatic so hopefully no shoes will impress me because I will buy them and add to the collection in my room. its going to be fun whether I get stuff or not because I just love shopping in general that's why my major is retail merchandising. I will get to shop for a major company like mace's or Nordstrom or even tiffany's. that is my dream. I want to have a base office in new York city and then travel all over buying merchandise for my company. I want to eventually be head person because I don't like being under someone else's control. but I know ill have to start from the bottom which is fine but u better believe I will work my butt off to fulfill my goals and dreams. my parents have been wanting me to come home for a weekend but I think not yet. I don't want to miss anything up here. it is so much fun at college!     \nAsnwer:"
