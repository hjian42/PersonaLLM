    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I sit staring at the blue syllabus from the class in front of me. What do  I write about? The sad part is that it seems like such a miniscule task. Write about what I'm thinking about. So now I ponder what I normally think about? What do I normally think about, but I'm supposed to be writing about what I'm thinking about right now. I'm thinking I should turn of the television behind me, yet I'm so attracted to this rerun that I have watched so many times. Although since I am writing this, I am not exactly paying attention to what is going on on the television. I can hear the faint noice in the background. Why can't I concentrate? I always have this problem. I feel that my attention span has shortened as I have gotten older. I have problems watching a thirty minute television program! How can I sit here for twenty minutes on task? Especially since I have a million things to do. Such as a paper in my Literature and the Law class. But I am not able to sit for a long time and simply work on that paper. How did I ever get into college? Sure my grades were somewhat decent, yet I always tend to work to the point of exhaustion, mainly because I procrastinate. When I procastinate I do all at once. since my attention span is so short, and I am not able to sit and continuously put forth a vast amount of effort my work comes out poorly. This must be why I have only decent grades. I must put forth more of an effort. Life can be extremely challenging especially since I am not able to do such a miniscule task of prioritizing. But why am I complaining about my grades? College has just begun! I can turn around and begin new! But I say this every time and it never happens. Sure you can change anything, but come on, am I actually gonig to do that? NO! I'm just pathetic in that way. Its like all the people I know who have broken promises. Sure everyone says they'll do this or that,but do they? I am always upset when people break promises because I never break promises to other people except to myself! I can stop being a procastinator, but do I? I can start exercising more, but do I? The most important person in my life,me , is the one person who I put last. Who cares how I look to others as long as I feel good inside. Do I feel good inside? Hard question. Do I have an answer? I don't know. I'm constantly criticizing myself. Come on sonia, you can be better at this or that. But do I make a point of actually becoming better no! I suppose all people are like this, they attempt to be someone their not. I have to just face the fact that I am who I am and if I really want to change I have the chance but I don't have to change! \nAsnwer:"
