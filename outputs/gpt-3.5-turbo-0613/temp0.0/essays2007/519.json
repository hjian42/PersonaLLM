No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: homework in the midst of my pre-cal assignment because my pre-cal is too long and really rather boring. plu, I need to catch up because I didn't start doing homework until the begiining of this week instead of doing a little each night, my mistake. I hope to finish this writting assignment, the pre-test, my pre-cal assignment and read some for astrology tomorrow. it's a lot but it will catch me up. then tomorrow I can begin my new pre-cal assignment and I can focus on my art project thurs and if necessary I can catch up on more psy. and pre-cal thursday evening. I'm also going to lunch with my frien james on thursday. james is a very good friend of mine and whenever I need to talk or unload my thoughts, james is excellent. plus, I'll put in a good couple of hours at my intern. david is going to teach me how to use my dad's camera and stuff so that sunday I can run another photo shoot and have some pictures developed. then, I'll have those pictures to play with and I plan on getting some of my negativesput on a cd disk so I can manipulate those pictures also. I have a very busy life going right now. I don't know how I cram it all in sometimes, but honestly, I like to have something to do at all times. I don't know why, I'm not very good at sitting still alone. only if I'm watching t. v. or something. I'll get my new job schedule on thurs. I just changed jobs because I was tired of working at the old one, that and I hadn't received a raise in a year. the sad thing is, I don't know if I'll be getting paid any more at this new place. as long as I don't take a pay cut I'll stay, I just need a new enviroment with new things to do. I'll be working at bath and body works, I think it'll be fun, because I like the things they sell there and I get to be the saleswomen. I enjoy selling things to people. my managers seem nice also. I might have to work at five in the morning a few times a year and I'm not looking forward to that at all. I've never done inventory before so I don't know what it involves, but I don't see the point in getting workers to the store at such an early hour if we'd be more productive a little later, even seven sounds more reasonable. I'd rather not worry about that until I know for sure that I'll be going in that early. I wonder what you're gather from all of my ramblings? five more minutes to go. I don't know how this is suppose to go, whather I should just write waht's on my mind or as if I'm talking to you at the other end. I gues in the end they're both going to get you the same stream of con. types of thoughts, huh?  I hope I can log onto the pre-test when I'm done with this, I tried it first and the server wouldn't let me on, yours or mine I don't know, I don't like computers much any how. I guess this was as good a way as any to put off the rest of my pre-cal since I'm being productive in the mean time. I could have gone and watched tv, or read my book (not some school assignment. ) well now, that wasn't hard at all, I guess I'm good at rambling. my time's up.  \nAsnwer:"
