I think it's funny how much I still depend on her - how much I still need her. I call her almost everyday. Sometimes just to hear her voice. It seems to comfort me and I don't really know why. Thank God she has a  0-000 number at her office, otherwise I would have to call collect and she probably wouldn't appreciate that. When I put the roast in the oven, I  started to think about all the meals she has ever cooked me. I wonder where she came up with all of her ideas. I only know how to cook three meals, and  they are not even that good. I wonder if my mom was born a good cook. She  probably was. That's what my dad says anyway. I kind of hope she wasn't  though, because then there might be hope for me. She told me that she taught herself. I hate when people say that. She had to have learned how somewhere. Maybe my grandmother taught her. She told me that she didn't, but she  probably did. My mom doesn't like my grandmother, so she probably doesn't  want to give her credit for anything. I guess I don't blame her. Now the  roast is starting to smell good. I love it when you come home and the whole place is filled with a mouth-watering aroma. Delicious! But it always smells the best when you're the one who is cooking. I wonder why that is. Maybe  it's because you-yourself created it. It's your own little personal accomplishment. I can't wait to taste my accomplishment. \nAsnwer:"
