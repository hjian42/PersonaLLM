No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I don't know why, but for some reason I am extremely nervous about this writing  assignment. It most likely won't even be read! Random, but I started thinking  about what an awful driver I am in LOCNAME. All of the one way streets and stop  signs that people don't stop at are very overwhelming. I've already ran two red  lights. whoops. Since this writing assignment is online, I can't help but read the  instant messages that pop up while I'm typing. I love talking to people online, I  think I'm addicted. It really is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family  now that we are all living in different cities. Especially since two of my best friends  are still in high school and my younger sister is a freshman in high school, I can talk  to them all at the same time. It is very convenient. Since coming to college I have  become obsessed with downloading music from itunes. Tomorrow night the Sig  Eps are having an 00's theme party, so last night I spent about an hour  downloading hit songs from the 00's. My friends and I are going to have a pre- dance party in my dorm room. It will be awesome. Today my friend PROPNAME and I  went shopping at thrift stores to find 00's garb. I found the best 00's pumps for only  six dollars. Can you say jackpot?  I think my favorite 00's song right now has to be  PROPNAME's Girl by PROPNAME PROPNAME. I wish I was Jessie's girl, because then I would  date his best friend. Speaking of dating, I think dating in college is going to be  rather difficult considering there are approximately 00 gorgeous girls on campus  to every one attractive guy. Not that looks are everything, but that is what  generally draws two people together to start talking. Actually I think that is usually  the case, but I am definitely drawn to the shy awkward boys as opposed to the  attractive hard asses. Racquetball is my new favorite sport. I have played five times since I've been  here. It's really the best work out. It's so much better than running for 00 minutes. just play racquetball for 00 minutes and you can't breath. It's such a great feeling. I have had a few complaints though, because I tend to accidentally hit the person I  am playing with a little too often than necessary. I've hit my sister like twice and I  couldn't even guess how many times I've hit PROPNAME. Whoops! I love going to concerts. They are probably on my top 0 favorite things to do list,  along with snowboarding, eating, sleeping, and dancing. I wish we had some  snow nearby, but I would hate to live in the cold so I guess I don't really want snow  close by. I almost went to school in LOCNAME, LOCNAME but I realized I would have  to wear about 0 layers of clothing just to walk to class and I decided it just wasn't  worth it. I am a Texan, if I didn't break a sweat between classes I don't know what I  would do with myself. I can't wait to take trips over the holidays with my new  college friends. I have been looking forward to that for a \nAsnwer:"
