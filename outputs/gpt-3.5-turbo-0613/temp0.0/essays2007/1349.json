I don't like spelling. you make me check my spelling but what I really want to do is just permanently change the way things are spelt. or make everyone think they way I do. wow wouldn't that be nice. hum to have everyone think the same as me. No not really. If everyone thought the same as me it would be one boring world. \"So PROPNAME how goes your thoughts on Abortion?\". response: \"I don't know. why don't you ask yourself. \". well I bet that isn't how the conversation would go. cause the other person wouldn't think they thought like me they would think I think like them. so about the only conflict would come up as to who is the original \"who\". But how about it we took different situations and then gave everybody my opinion?. but that is a lot of work. and I don't feel like that. Speaking of no feeling like working. I don't feel like working. hehe you don't know it but I just misspelled feel. I wrote fell instead. Lets think about that. if a cow falls in a hole how would it get out. I guess you would have to build stairs huh. no not really you could just pull the damn thing out. Damn Cows way in the world are they even falling in holes. don't they know not to do shat like that? Oh yeah like that little baby. who was it?. oh baby PROPNAME(I think). wouldn't suck to fall in a hole? Heheh. I was watching a movie the other day(big big movie buff) called \"Cecil B. Demented\"  it was a great movie. one guy in the movie(he is from another movie called \"Drive me Crazy\"(don't ever see that one). but in this movie he is a drug addict. not the scary kind that look like skeletons and shat but the funny kind that take every kind of drug. back to my point. at one point he is trying to run away but he is running in place. his excuse you ask. he's stuck in a KB hole. hehehe. I think its funny even if you aren't laughing. You ever think about that. when I write something on the computer it just doesn't laugh. damn computer. doesn't have a sense of humor. perhaps if I ripped all its cords out it would be laughing. \"hahahahaha\". no no not really. That is mean. HUM. new topic okie. I like to look around and see how everybody has their own style. some like to wear tight clothes some wear funky stuff. if people have an \"outgoing\" style does that mean they are caught up in unimportant things such as outer beauty?. no not at all. people often like to dress up. in that fun sort of way. or they like to do stuff like that. alright I'm bored of this conversation. really I am. PROPNAME I am. I will not eat green eggs and ham. oh poor Dr. PROPNAME. he's six feet under. Man I saw part of the Emmys last week. they shown all the movie stars who had died. sniff. YI think a nice thing to paint is reflections. they are really pretty. I have a lot of stuff to do. ugh. the word stuff is so slang. (said in a valley girl way. ) \"That word was just like so SLANG\" (nose pointed up and with a quick twist she leaves the room). I think I should start saying something else besides \"Stuff\". \"I have a lot of things to do\". \" I have many things to do\". \"My agenda is full right now can you call back at a later date and then maybe we can set something up for you. no. no sir you don't understand my calendar runs out after October and I won't be getting a new one for at least another week. So I'm going to need you to call back to set up the appointment. alrighty sir. you have a nice night. bye\" (click) \"Y'all come back now you hear\". BUH  \nAsnwer:"
