I am so tired right now, but I'm not going to take a nap because I have a lot of things to do today. Last night was my roommates birthday. She had a meeting that she had to go to from 0-00pm, so we couldn't go out to dinner. Instead, when she got home, I had gotten a couple presents and she opened them. She started to cry, telling my that it was the first time anyone had ever celebrated her birthday. I find it so strange to find out about the different types of childhoods and life that all of my new friends here have experienced. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and the things that I might think are very common may actually be new things for some people. That is why I am enjoying living in the dorm right now and meeting all sorts of people. I love to study and figure out why people are the way they are and what makes them act the way they act. Anyway, my rhetoric class this morning wasn't too bad. Once I'm up and out of bed, I can usually get to class and do everything that I need to do. In my biology class, my teacher gave us a quiz. We hadn't been told about it and it was over a chapter that most people hadn't read yet. The quiz was worth 0 points and I got 0. Three points was about the average of the class. My professor isn't American and he doesn't articulate his words. This makes it very hard to understand and take notes. Luckily, I had a lab this afternoon and the LOCNAME was able to explain the lecture and help clarify so of the notes. Today, I am going to go to TOPS to get some of the pictures that I took this weekend. I am so excited because I don't have many pictures on my wall right now. My suitemate said that she would make me a bulletin board. She is very artistic and creative, so I know it will be really cute. Tonight, I have a meeting for my sorority. I chose to go Tri-Delt. I really like all the girls and we have been hanging out a lot. Everyone gets along pretty well, but there are always groups of people that tend to cling together. I have tried to make friends with as many of them as I can. Right now everyone is worrying about where they should live next year. It's kind of frustrating because it is so soon. How do we know who we will be friends with and hang out with in a year from now? I guess you just pick and hope for the best. My roommate and I decided to live together and both of us have been asked to live with other girls from our sororities. So, we decided to get an apartment together and we have 0 other girls that we have met that are going to live with us. I really hope we all get along and I'm sure everything will work out! \nAsnwer:"
