Today was the draw for tickets to the ORGNAME game. It was an incredibly hectic day because all of the pledges of my fraternity had to wake up early to get to the stadium so we could draw tickets for all of the actives. Not to mention all the walking we had to do which was especially painful for me because i slice off a huge piece of skin off the back of my heel so it hurts every step I take. Lacrosse practice is also tonight and the gash on my heel is going to be extremly painful tonight when he have to run. I am also still sore from tuesday's lacrosse practice. I am glad that I finally sat down to complete this assignment because i have been putting it off all week. Tomorrow I am going to LOCNAME to visit my parents. I am extremely excited to be going back to LOCNAME especially since we have a new dog. My parents got a weiner dog puppy. It has short hair on its body and hairy ears, i cannot wait to play with it. All i can think about is how i have been running around all day today and even last night. My pledge brothers and I had to go around to other dorms and knock on random people's doors asking them for their UT ID's so we could use their sports packages to draw tickets for our fraternity. I am also pledge class president and have realized that it is going to consist of me doing alot of crap. The pledge trainer talked to me today and talked to me about my responsibilities and I have a feeling that some of my pledge brothers might let me down. I went to bed at 0 this morning and woke up at 000, I am so tired, i just wish i could go to sleep right now, but i can't because i have to go to a mandatory BA 000 lecture in an hour. I am also going home this weekend so that i can have my parents do my laundry because i know that they will do a much better job than i would. I am also going to see some of my friends in LOCNAME who are now seniors in high school, including my old girlfriend and a couple of other pretty girls. I haven't seen them in a while and it should be a good time. My suitemate's cell phone just rang and I imagine that it is the fraternity calling him. He is my pledge brother but he is kind of annoying, we just let him as to pad the numbers since we were a few pledges short. My leg muscles are still aching from lacrosse practice and my heel injury is haunting me. I am going to be late to practice because i have my BA000 lecture til 000 and practice begins at 0, which is good because that means i will not have to run the compound, which is a lap around the fenceline of the intramural field complex, it is one hell of a run. Since i have been here I have not really watched much television so I am falling behind on my favorite sports teams, especially the astros. The texans won their first game last weekend and it was one hell of a game. Me and my buddy ordered wings and that was the start of our ritual for texans games. My roomate just walked in and wanted to know if i wanted to go swimming but the towers pool is disgusting and i will never go swimming there. Two girls just came to the door to get their IDs which i had to use to draw tickets for the OU game. I had to throw on a shirt because i was half naked and they were gone when i came back, but oh well. One of the girls who came by is my date to the OU game. OU weekend is going to be extremely fun,  It will basically consists of getting trashed several nights in a row and watching the horns kick OU's ass. Our fraternity rented a charter bus and it is going to be a good time. I am about to get dressed and ready for lacrosse practice so that right after my lecture i can catch the bus to the field. THe bus i have to catch is the IF bus and i have no idea where it picks up so hopefully i will be able to make it to the field at a decent time. If not, i would be perfectly content going back to towers and sleeping. But i have calculus homework that is due at 0 am so later i have to have my buddy help me out because i do not understand somne of the work, i am a little over half way done but it should not take very much longer. My roomate is awfully weird, why the hell would he want to live in towers his sophomore year. It would be much cheaper to rent an apartment with some friends rather than live in towers and deprive me of the chance of making a good friend out of my roomate. He is just so boring and always is around, even when i bring girls home, it is freekin annoying. the problem with this assignment is that some of the thoughts i am tracking are thought about what i am going to write next which makes this seem artificial because i have to think about what i am thinking about. I have had 0 hours of sleep in the last 00 hours are so and i am damn tired, i need a freekin nap and i think i am about to hit the snooze button for 00 minutes \nAsnwer:"
