No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      Right now I feel kind of tired from schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Last night I felt cranky and could not concentrate much. I think it had something to do with having two tests on a given thursday. My nose is sort of stuffy and my eyes seem to be watery. I noticed today that the sky was a little cloudy as I walked to all of my classes. I thought that meant that there was high humidity or something. Possibly too much water in the air meant that there was more sweating and less evaporation of the sweat. I just came back from the student service building to get two vaccinations. One for meningitis and the other for Hepetitus B. I felt worried about diseases when I arrived on campus. In addition to the worries, I obtained a pamplet from the student services building recommending that I get the shots. My left arm feels a little different than usual. The nurse warned me of possible side effects but I was not too worried about that because I do not have any known allergic reactions. I think I try to type faster than I am able to and because of it I seem to make many mistakes in my typing requiring me to use the backspace key often. I think that when I was learning how to type I emphasized speed more importantly than preciseness or acuratcy. My neck and shoulders feel a little tight and cramp. My lower back pain has been giving me some trouble. I remember seeing the chiropractor about a month ago and he told me a little exercise would do just fine. I felt relieved knowing that my x-ray results were good. I came out to be that I had an extra lower back vertabrae. Not too rare but not particurally normal. My eyes are now feeling dry and probably red by now. Ever since I started wearing contacts , for about 0 years now, I've been worried about the dryness, redness, and clarity of my eyes. I might need to use some eye drops now. I think it might have something to do with my shots but the nurse did warn me about possible side effects. I usually don't think stuff like that will effect me directly. Although some things that i don't think effect me usually do. For instance when I got into my car crash about three months ago  I didn;t think that it would happen to me. My parents would tell be to be careful in the rain but I would usually ignore that fact that I'll end up in an accident. I wouldn't rool me eyesor anything disrepectful, but I would just let the message slide. I would later realized that the message was important just made iinto a routine thing to say from my parents. I should really try harder to listen to people than to jsut make them fell good at the moment. I sometiems feel that people don't listen to thers anymore. they just try to make rapport with each other including nonverbal communications. Girls might do this more than guys. but i think i do it enough to make me feel comfortable. I would really like one day without realizing my lower back problems. It's not that bad but it;s annoying for me to worry about as much as i do. I crack my nect and back like every thirty minutes. I'ts becoming routine just like people reminding you to drive safely like at night. This is different though. I't what I say to myself. I wonder if that will ever be ignore. Probably not since it's not someone else controlling me but myself. Control is difficult to explain. I'm wondering when this will end. another minute or so. After a whild of this I started ignoring the computer screen and just started to stare adn my keyboard checking to see it my fingering is good or not. I don't think i;m a fast typer or a good typer. Just an average typer that makes too moany typing mistakes. Less by looking at my fingers.  \nAsnwer:"
