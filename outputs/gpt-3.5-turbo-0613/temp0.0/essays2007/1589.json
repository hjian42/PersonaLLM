No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: you know, this is sort of a bizzare assignment. you would think that one would just start listing off a bunch of items like  dog, cat, mouse. etc. however, it that was the case, would there be some sort of indication of what the persons mind was filled with?  maybe. maybe not. so i essence in reflecting on the kind of determination that can be made from something like this leaves one in kind of a quandry. let's see the desk i'm sitting at is hard. it's wooden, so why not?  i'm in a library so aside from the loud typing noise i and others like me are making. all is quiet. you know, speaking of quiet, that is another thing that comes to mind. as i was reading an   e-card   sent to me by my wonderful girlfriend just minutes ago, i was unable to trully get a whole and complete apreciation of them due to this surrounding silence. allow me to explain. as i am obligated by the nature of this assignment to just contimuously spit out thought as they come to me. it limits the amount of organization of said thoughts. anyway, so i assume that whoever is in charge of these convinient little computer stations in the library, has taken it upon themselves to make sure all the volume controls have been pre set to a level of zero. you know. a library. concentration etc. so i guess that's not really volume control at all is it?  well, at least no control for the common user such as myself. control to the administrator or whatever. so back to the oriinal point of the e-card. these little messages provided by different. providers i guess wouldbe the first thing that comes to mind usually have some sort of audio accompinament (sp). now, reiterating the fact that all the volumes control has been taken away from me and others like me, i literally could not hear an of what was going on. that was unfortunate. quite. so i guess i'm going to have to find some other place to enjoy to it's full potential what was intended to be read as well as heard. that is kind of a round-a-bout way to say that i was unsatisfied with the events that unfolded in regards to the   all silent   rule in libraries. i had never really thought about that side of it before. of course there have been an uncountable amount of times that i've sat in a library and truly enjoyed the silence that it provides. . always just thinking that that is the way it should be. silent. no noise. i always envisioned some nasty old librarian with some kind of   sonar   hearing just out to bust the hidden conversations wherever they inevitably pop up throughout the establishment. of course there's always the issue of the cellular phones. oh, man- have we gone NUTS with the phones!!! what is the deal with that!?  has it truly come to the point that p person is in such need to be in contact with everyone and anyone that they have to be totally and at everyone's disposal. is there something THAT pressing for everyone?  i really wonder. i know there are those buisness men and women that just depend on that kind of continual interaction with . whoever they interact with. i guess i just have a hard time relating because there just is not that scenario in my life. in fact i would go so far as to say that i would be very uncomfortable to be THAT availabel all the time. i mean that would put me in a very akward position. always with someone wanting something. someone calling. someone bugging. AHHHHHH that just drives me crazy even thinking about it. there's something funny i just remembered. it's in the out takes from some movie with PROPNAME chan and ohh what's his name. i can't remember. that black guy from friday. o chris tucker. so they're in some scene and it was obvious that chris tucker had forgotten his line or at least that's the way it seemed and then out of nowhere his cell phone rings. just like that!  here they are- rolling that expensive 00 millimeter film and the man is talking on his phone. he says somthing like:    no man, i can't talk right now. we're shooting. yea man. right now. i'm standing right here with jackie chan. .   it went on for a couple more seconds and the guy wouldn't believe tucker and as it went on . jackie was getting frustrated. chris tucker had to prove it to his friend that he really was shooting so he gave the phone to jackie who said hey, we can't talk now. in his oriental accent. it  was funny.        \nAsnwer:"
