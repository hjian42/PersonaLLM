No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Stream of consciousness---I am not sure what to write at all  everything in my head  comes in little spurts of information. \"Turn the radio on, turn the radio up, and this woman was singing my song,  lover is crying cause the other won't stay. my stomach hurts and I have to go to the bathroom, I think I just saw PROPNAME PROPNAME Now that I have to think about something I can't. which is strange because usually I think too much about  everything right now that song by PROPNAME PROPNAME keeps running through my head even though I really hate that song. I feel really bad for Princess PROPNAME's kids. but I actually have that morbid curiosity  to see the pictures of the accident scene and it makes me feel awful. do I have to work tomorrow?  My bangs keep getting in my face---I should never have gotten them My roommate is bothering me right now. she always leaves hair on the bathroom sink and on the floor  and it really disgusts me, especially in the morning when I am already in a bad mood, and  sometimes she gets this real high moral attitude with me like she knows better and doesn't want to break the rules by painting the walls because Mr. PROPNAME might get mad, yet she has all this pot in her closet What a hypocrite!  I hope I make ORGNAME ORGNAME, although I have to admit that I thought the whole thing was really fake  Okay, now really nothing is going through my head I wonder if the people next to me are looking at what I am writing, they better not, that is such an invasion of privacy, although I would look at theirs  any day. there is this disk sitting right here and it is not mine but I want to use it because I didn't bring a disk so that I could check email but I don't even know whether or not it is formatted for a PC, that guy was really cute. I wish I was in LOCNAME right now. wow these computers really filled up fast ---there is already a line to get on them oh well too bad for them. oh damn I forgot to go get that course packet for government, oh I need to call that ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME number I think they changed the computer system here in the SMF because the setup is different, that guy reminds me of somebody but I can't think who, I wonder if I can check my email without a disk If that is PROPNAME PROPNAME he sure got fat. I wonder if I need to bring my psychology book today, but I don't think I have time to walk all the way home and then walk back, I will just share with PROPNAME I need to check on my stocks, maybe they have finally earned me some money, and I need to get my portfolio going. I want my car back  \nAsnwer:"
