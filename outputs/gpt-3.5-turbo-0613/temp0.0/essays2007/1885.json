No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      Well, today is September 00, 0000 and that of course means that my day was filled will deep thoughts and feelings and constant reminders of the tragedy that happened a year ago today. I remember exactly where i was the day the Twin Towers collapsed. I had just woken up and was on my way to class when i bumped into my boyfriend at the time who was on his way up to his dorm room. He stopped me and said   did you hear what happened?   Puzzled i scratched my head and shrugged i had been asleep up until like 00 min ago and now i was in such a hurry to get to my class that i had been oblivious of my surroundings. I now looked around the lobby to see that every t. v. had a cluster of people around it with their mouths hanging open. There was a whisper and constant murmur in the air that i hadn't noticed before.   What happened?   i asked. He started blurting about this and that about World Trade Centers being bombed or something to that effect. I sighed and said   really, that's terrible  , then i scurried off to class. Little did i know that what i had dismissed as simply government/political jumble would have such a severe impact on LOCNAME and myself. When i walked into my class i was met with the same constant murmur, it seemed to be everywhere. I sat down in my seat(front row) and looked up to see that ORGNAME was being shown on a huge screen at the front of the classroom.  My mouth dropped in horror and terror filled me as i watched with my very own eyes, one of the planes slam into a huge tower. It was then that i realized how serious this thing was. Then the second plane, and after that the third. LOCNAME was being attacked. That phrase played inside my head fueling the growing terror inside me. LOCNAME was attacked and would never be the same again. It was then that i realized something else. My mom was out of town. She had left on a business trip for the week to. was it LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME? It was an annual trip and i remember her saying it was 00 minutes away from D. C. Wasn't that where the ORGNAME was? I remember thinking i needed to call my dad as soon as possible to find out where my mom was. After class i ran to my dorm and found i had a message i pushed it and was more than relieved to hear my mom's familiar, and now beautiful voice telling me not to worry that she was okay but might be late coming back home cause of flight delays. Even now i have tears in my eyes thinking about how lucky i am to still have both of my parents and my family. I couldn't even imagine losing them especially in such a tragic way. Then this makes my feel so sad for the people who weren't as lucky. I pray for them and even though i have been extremely busy and overwhelmed i made it a point to go home to visit my family because you never know what could happen. My family is not a very expressive one and we hardly ever show our emotions for each other show, but yesterday i left my mom with a genuine   i love you   and a hug. \nAsnwer:"
