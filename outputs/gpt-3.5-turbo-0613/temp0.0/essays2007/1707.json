The first thing that comes into my mind is how slow I type and it is not any easier typing on a laptop. I wish my regular computer waS WORKING. OOPS I JUST PUSHED THE CAPS LOCK BORGNAMETON. thats better. I also can't help but think how hungry I am. Maybe I should go down to the cafateria and get a quick byte. Than again I could just make something real quick that taste much better. geez this bracelet doesn't make it easier to type either. thats better. Maybe if I move the laptop onto my lap. eh. . somewhat better. My girlfriend should be comming back soon. I am glad she joined a sorority. it gives me some space. I wish she would understand that I need my space. oh well that will just be an ongoing argument between the two of us. there goes my stomach again. My suitmate should be leaving soon for a fraternity event. To bad erik's parents wouldn't let him join a fraternity. this song is catchy. but it is played out. I am so mad about my car. I don't understand how a brand new car won't start. At least I got it into the shop quick. I hope I get it back tomorrow. LOCNAME LOCNAME's new cd is so amazing. I wish jennifer didn't give me such a hard time about putting it on. I think I will listen to it aftter I finish typing. I am half way through. This assignment is pretty cool. I never realized how much I could write in twenty minutes. my psychology class is huge. I wonder how many people are in it. It has got to be at least 000 kids. It is so different seeing a teacher standing infront of all those kids. they even have a microphone. Those huge projectors that are built into the wall are so awesome too. I hate commercials. . I wonder when I will get to use my checks for the first time. I have never had to use a check before. I think I will like going to UT. Its only been a week and a half and I love it. It is so stressful living at home. Always having to do somehting. I know that my parents do everything for me, but they always keep me busy. I wonder what I can eat. I wonder how long I can last without eating. Maybe PROPNAME will get back soon and make me a great meal. She is so good to me. I really do Love her. I hope my dad gets me those Incubus tickets. I really want to go. ORGNAME is always on the radio. . I wonder what he was talking about at the vma's the other night. Something about punching a guy with glasses. I wonder if evereybody thinks the way I do. I know that my mind is really weird. I don't even understand my self sometimes. I jump from thought to thought so quickly. I hope I learn something about myself in psychology. I wonder is college is going to be hard. Well I only have two minutes left I think I should see what other homework I might have. 00 seconds left and all I can think about is eating. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. . \nAsnwer:"
