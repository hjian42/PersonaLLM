No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: clicking of the keyboards, a bunch of freshman psy 000 students. pennebaker glasses. the computer man has a dark and conservative sense of humor?  who cares. people smelling the library books. Korean couples. It is twice that I said today about two different people that I hardly know these people, but I really miss them. The computer proctor's laugh is the same as always, like an unusual yet common icon that. keyboards. I feel like a small ant in a row of computers. the library hums. shelves of books to hide in. humid outside. my roommate and PROPNAME. she's happy?  She really misses her friends. he laughed again. he has a strange sense of humor. low voice. I have no structure or purpose to my thoughts because I came to the computer with no purpose but catching the breathing patterns of my thoughts. backpack, lunch box. zipper. cough. school supplies. the table is smooth and shiny, like in all typical libraries. PROPNAME was here last time. PROPNAME PROPNAME at the tower. Aren't they categorizing me?  it doesn't seem so. there must be some kind of positive--computer beep, boring monochromatic computer games, 00pm at a church person's house, old kids that are nice and well-rounded. Jan reminds me of a deer. her boyfriend is spazmatic, if that is a word. talking. abelardo ireguas. esther has this distinct smell--like her house--not necessarily bad. short guy's hoarse voice. phobia. short \"dancing-man's weird son\". carrot, pickles?  what does he remind me of?  screen doors?  who cares. she is always tired and kind of moody, and I really really hope it is not contagious. woman wearing yellow and short hair. science. Mrs. PROPNAME. biology lab. Mrs. pitts is colorful. she laughs at the right times. she has a bunny nose. computer, two guys who know my parents. I must stop smoking, I can't stop. I made it worse!  Why did I say that to what's his face, back in LOCNAME?  He may think I'm a moron. He's a moron. no, it's okay. finger stuck in elevator. shara has a helpless look on her face. the PROPNAME twins, facial hair, boring people, volleyball. Hospital air. mommy--So fragile. organization of shelves. computer grunts when it thinks. keyboard. I don't feel like writing long and comprehensive sentences because I have nicotine in my system. computer beep, boring monochromatic computer games. I don't explore on computers, I can't. perfectionist. I will get rid of that!  it's a waste of time. BALANCE. church on Fri and Sun, will I blend and belittle the past?  yes?  yes. Structure. plastic mug, sunny and old porch. Submit, in a nice. I'm irritated. okay, she looked away. I\u2019m still irritated. I hate it when I\u2019m irritated!  my mom irritates me, some peoples heads irritate the life out of me, if they act like my mom. computer, worthless projects. I\u2019m irritated. I\u2019m irritated, like only being pierced by a fire would alleviate it. I sometimes hate it when I lose control, but it is sometimes fun. paranoia. lose track of time and dimension that all people share and get into my own mode, like falling off into space, and then I get paranoid when people have a blank stare, or silence. whatever. no, not whatever. I must stop thinking in wasteful cycles!  I--there's that laugh again. I think he's funny. I just know I\u2019ll run into him again!  I just know it. some foreign setting (in the LOCNAME LOCNAME). me happy and self-conscious. that laugh again!  it's sunny outside, and gross picnic food, trees, breeze. backpack, voice, tall guy, it's already been twenty minutes, but I can't stop. I wish I could do both assignments today!  I don't understand why I can't. Peeping shelves. harmony. trendy crap. woman laugh like mid-thirties with a freckled tan and sunglasses and I gotta go be a semi-perfectionist. I had fun. key \nAsnwer:"
