No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: anyway, I have really enjoyed the weather lately. its so wonderful to have some change from the usual hot crap we've been going through lately. I think the weather change is making my life better. I hate the heat. it was so intense this summer. this weekend proves to be an exciting one with many things on the agenda. concerts, barbecue and hanging out with friends are what I'm really looking forward to. I recently broke up with my girlfriend so this whole change of pace has been good to me. things are looking positive and it makes me happy. I'm sure that makes sense. I'm really excited about school this year. I think things are going to go well. I like my classes. I find the nature of the courses to be really interesting. I'm sure that's pretty helpful as well. another helpful thing I've learned is than riding the bus is so much easier than walking to school. oh gosh its 000x's better. wow, this is only 0 minutes of writing. I'm so tired. my contacts are bothering me, the screen is WAY too bright and its way to early. I can still hear drizzle outside my window. in looking at the syllabus, I see that a test is approaching. it would probably be wise to begin studying for it. gosh. I'm hungry. I guess ill give my thoughts on the whole PROPNAME scandal. I think it is incredibly sick in what they are doing to this man. to release the details of an intimate relationship he had to the public is both immoral and degrading to society. I feel for his family and the torment they must be going through. I would hate to be in chelsea's position right now. this must be so tough for her to read and go through. damn that ken starr - nazi asshole. I'm offended that he would go to great lengths to find out about the presidents sex life. if they impeach PROPNAME, I'm going to be extremely worried about the country. I don't feel al gore is an appropriate leader at this time. who know, however. he may be suitable. I just think it would all be really stupid if this crap continued on. the starr report was so graphic. it sounded like an explicit porno. wait. it was. too bad it was real life. I'm glad nobody is going to read this. its a stupid waste of time. haha, just kidding. wait. if I tell a bad joke. and nobody is here to read/hear it. is it still bad?  INCREDIBLE. I'm an amazing human being and I'm glad to be alive!!!!!  \"I can't take much more of this. these coffee makers full of piss. these people treat my like a dog. and all I do is write these songs. I'm not a toy.  \" - Dynamite Boy. \"as long as I live I can never forget you. even though I try with all my might\" - dynamite boy . \"I want to. see if you. by chance you know what I'm going through\" - dynamite boy. \"what's going on tonight. is everything alright. I hope there is nothing wrong. I haven't seen you in so long. what exactly do you do. when I'm not with you. what exactly do you say. all the times that I'm away. \" - MxPx. those two bands are incredible. SHAFT RITALIN KIDS DYNAMITE BOY THE CRIPPLES THE IMPOSSIBLE 00 FT FALL WADBOY SIX CENTS FRAT DADDIES THE MISS MEN THE INCREDIBLE FEAT IGMO ANTHEM LATCH KEY KIDS FOUR TO ONE BIG PEPPER . . rock on punks! haha that is the stupidest thing I've ever written. and I know you guys have time things on this so I can't end early. I have to actually wait the entire time. its ok. only 0 minutes left. . I need some massive sleep. not a little sleep. MASSIVE SLEEP. what a retarded human being I am. oh you. 0 minutes. I'm seriously running out of things to tell you folks. I'M NOT SUBJECT TO MEDICAL RESEARCH. I'M A PERFECTLY SANE HUMAN BEING. JUST BECAUSE I BIT OFF MY TOES DOESN'T MEAN I'M ABNORMAL. THEY JUST LOOKED SO YUMMY. man I was already falling asleep when I began to worry about this class. . sheeeeeeesh. SNORRRE. some friends tried to get me to do mushrooms tonight and I said no. how's that for some backbone. hell yea. I'm the man. mom and dad would be proud of me. too bad I'm not going to tell them I hang out with people who do drugs. I've never understood the fad with drugs. id rather drink a coke and get hyper than ingest some poison. but then again, I'm a wuss. oh well. JUST SAY NO. yea. uh huh. one more minute one more minute one more minute one more minute one more minute . done. \nAsnwer:"
