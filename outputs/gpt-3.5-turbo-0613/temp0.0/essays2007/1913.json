No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I hope that this 00 minutes goes by fast because I hate typing and Big Brother 0 is on in the living room and I can hear it but I can't see it. My leg itches and now so does my shoulder. It's funny how when you think about something itching then lots of parts of your body start to itch. I have an economics quiz tomorrow that I still have to study for. Maybe I will ask PROPNAME to get me ready for it. It's my first one in college so I don't know what to expect. So 00 minutes is a long time because I am out of things to say and it has only been 0 minutes. My lips are kind of chapped but I don't feel like getting up to get the chapstick form the bathroom. My head itches a lot today. I think it must be from the weather. Now my arm hurts my holding it up to type since The Towers does not give us a place to put our keyboards so they have to sit up high on the desk. I have such bad posture when I type. I slouch over a lot which makes my upper back sore. I don't know if I can go for 00 minutes without going through some intense pain. It has been almost 00 hours since I have talked to my mom. She must think that I have been abducted. I will call her after this long assignment. I wish someone would call me because I am so bored and it is the first night that I have stayed home alone. But I have had a lot of homework so it is good that I have been home to get it done. I need to give myself a pedicure when I go home this weekend. my toenails are getting really long. I think I will go to the high school football game on Friday if my brother goes but I am sure he will since the love of his life is on the dance team. My teeth feel really grungy. I guess I didn't brush them after I got back from dinner. But man was dinner good. I love beef chalupas but I love them more when my mom makes them and puts guacamole on them. I emailed a lot of people yesterday and I wonder if they have emailed me back. Probably not since everyone is busy with the start of school but oh well. Man it is really cold in here. If I turn up the air then it just gets too hot and I would rather be too cold than too hot. Except for in the mornings when I step out into the hall to go to class. it is freezing out there and then it is really warm in the elevators. This place has really bad temperature control. I have not gotten any mail so far. it would be nice to know that people still love me and miss me. They are about to announce the veto on BB0 so I am listening in to see what PROPNAME is doing. She is giving a whole life story up there and she used the veto on herself which is smart. Anyways I still have 0 minutes left. This has goe by pretty fast but now my wrists are hurting a little. Maybe I am developing carpultunel (sp?) syndrome. That can't be good. I miss my dogs a lot. They were so cute when I went home this weekend. I miss sleeping with Pita. my bed is so lonely without her. Maybe I should get a guy to replace her. That sounds like a good idea. I can't wait until the new and last season of Friends starts in late September. I am going to cry at the season finale. My roommate just said how happy she is that she didn't take this class because this assignment although not mentally hard is quite physically hard. Only 0. 0 minutes left. Oh happy day. I wonder if any of my friends are online so that I can talk to them when I am done with this. My bracelets are starting to dig into my wrist since I am putting pressure on them to type. I need to get some more stuff to decorate my room. It looks so plain compared to my friends' room but their room has too much stuff in it. My time is almost up now. I only have thirty seconds left. Man that really did go by now that I think about it. I hope we don't have any more assignments like this one. My hands hurt!   \nAsnwer:"
