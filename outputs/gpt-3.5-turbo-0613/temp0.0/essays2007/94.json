That idea about the red churches in LOCNAME is really outrageous. The queen will never go for it. Anyway it was random of me to have seen him. I haven\u2019t seen him since PROPNAME played. Our power went out at the dorm and it really sucks. I waned to this assignment there but I obviously couldn\u2019t. The rain today was so random. It was sunny then light again. My dorm seems o be the only one that lost power though. This keyboard is sticky and I don't like it very much. I cant wait till the weekend. At least I donut have too much work to do immediately. Most of it is due Tuesday. That boy is sooo cute. I donut understand why all of the cute ones are jerks 00 percent of the time. Can we say PROPNAME?  He totally ignored me at that party but he e-mailed PROPNAME for my number What's up with that? Jerk. I wish he would just make it easier on he both of us and just give me a call. Hello it's not that hard. I hope I meet some new guys soon cause these sure aren\u2019t doing the job, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing PROPNAME again. He is sooooo hot. However I know that I could never have a good relationship with a boy like that. Shit, I couldn\u2019t even hold PROPNAME's attention. Then again he's a jerk. Anyway, I wonder how the boys are doing in apartment life. I just donut see them all living out on their own. I wonder how PROPNAME and PROPNAME are doing at ORGNAME ?  They should be coming down for a weekend soon enough. I guess PROPNAME would call me if she's planning to come back any time soon. it is really convenient having been from here. I already know my way around and I know so many people. it is awesome. I cant believe my roommate was so loud last night when I was obviously trying to sleep. That is totally inconsiderate and she knows that I have an eight o\u2019clock. I'm never loud when I have to get up at seven in the freakin morning, I feel like I should be loud sometime just to get my point across,  I donut want to be rude to he though because I have to live with her a whole year and I might as well make the most of it Anyway my twenty minutes is over so I'm out. \nAsnwer:"
