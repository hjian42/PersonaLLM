Well, I'm in the computer lab right now because I  didn't want to do this on my home computer which is pretty messed up at the moment. I don't  feel like writing about it. It's quiet in here, and the computers are quite nice. All I hear are the  tapping of keyboards. Tap tap tap. and what else?  I don't nkow. I wish I was doing this in my  room so I could be listening to music. The flaming lips which I'm especially into right. I  recently bought zaireeka, a fusion of the words zaire and eureeka by them but haven't been  able to play it yet. It's a kind of confusing record I guess is the word to talk about. But I've still  got like 00 minutes so why not?  It's a 0 cds played in unision concept record by the flaming  lips. wayne PROPNAME says it's supposed to be about chaos and inspiration or something. it makes  sense, trust me. but when I got people over to play it with me (you need 0 cd players and 0  people who want to help play and listen to it with you to play it) it was all chaos and no  inspiration. no one really had more than passing curiosity, and when it wasn't going all that  smoothly people gave up quickly. but yeah, I still want to play it, just need some people with  passion? to hear it with me. what else?  blah blah blah. I can't think of anything to write about. 000 000 I'm almost halfway done. some people are talking in another language across from me  now. I don't nkow what language. oh, now they're leaving. I think they're indian?  so what  language does that mean they speak??  I just wrote a sentence and deleted it. I think maybe  you're not supposed to do that?  don't think it really matters. man, I think this assignment is  kind of too long. ten minutes would've been enough. all these people are leaving around me. they're going outside into the sunshine. and I'm staring at this screen. I just spent a while  trying to figure out how to do that prescreening stuff too. I registered but then I couldn't find a  link anywhere on the site that led to the actual survey. what's up with that?  I emailed wendy or  whoever. got to remember to do that later now. prescreening survey. do it before sep 0 I think. that's like 0. 0 hours credit. we've hit the fifteen minute mark, friends. that makes this the  homestretch. that's sports lingo. not that I know anything about sports. man, that football  game yesterday was annoying. it brings out all the rowdy yelling people in the streets. and it's  so CROWDED, you know?  I hate it when it gets so crowded on campus, I dread going through  it. so many people!  why did I go to a school with fifty thousand students?  I'm spelling out the  numbers now, did you notice?  because why rush?  no reason, that's why. type tyep type. stream. of. conscious. yep, that's what I'm doing. almost done. nineteen minutes complete,  one minute to go. come on, so close. I'm so close to being outside away from the flourescent   li \nAsnwer:"
