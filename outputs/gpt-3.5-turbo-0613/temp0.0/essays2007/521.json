No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: it cuts into my social time and I hate that I can't do some things because I have to get ready for my classes the next day. I enjoy college that much. well I enjoy the social aspects and the fact that I can meet all kinds of new and interesting people, but I am so sick of school and the first week isn't even over yet. that is very sad. I wonder if everyone is this way. well at least I am trying to get a head start on all the psychology requirements. if I get them out of the way immediately then I don't have to worry about them at the end of the semester when I need to be worrying about my other finals. I am very grateful that we don't have a final in this psychology course. psychology is very interesting to me. I don't think I could pursue a career in it though. I just think it is neat to study what people are thinking and why they are thinking things. I think I can handle the class. think I can handle everything this semester. I just hope that I don't get too homesick and that I get along well with everyone. I can't wait to see PROPNAME my childhood friend. he is so smart. he is fixing to start working on his phd in pharmacology. he hasn't always been this smart. when he got into high school his brain started to kick in gear I guess. ever since then he has made straight A's and has been the class genius. I guess what he needed was a boost of self confidence. his brother on the other hand needs confidence and motivation more than anyone I know. he irritates me sometimes because everyone has to go to him and he won't go do anything without people forcing him to go. I love him though. it is funny how someone can irritate you to death but because you've known him forever you have to accept his faults and still  love him. it is funny how people are so impressed with money and the people that have a lot of it. if you had a bunch of money you could have instant friends. it drives me crazy that people don't look at the person but what the person  has. you end up worse for it because that person that has all the money  just ends up annoying everyone else. anyway there are some people out there that aren't like that and don't go crazy over someone because they have a lot of money. that is one thing I have learned that you can't stereotype people at all because there are always exceptions to the rules. well my twenty minutes up and it went by real fast. it is funny how fast time goes by when your mind is preoccupied or you are having fun. I think it is neat. \nAsnwer:"
