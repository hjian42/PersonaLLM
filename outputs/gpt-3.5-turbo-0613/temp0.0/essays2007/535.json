No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: for some reason I just don't find a hairy chest on a guy that asthetically pleasing, but if I shave will it grow back much thicker, there is only one way to find, I used to shave my legs in high school for sports and I don't have thick black hair now. I know this much if I were to shave my chest I would use the new mach three from gillette. for some reason , I have such an infatuation with this new razor over the past week since I bought it. I usually get razor burn no matter what I do before or after I shve, but with mach 0 I put it to the test and I didn't even get a scratch. I read something that said it was designed to make you want to get up at two in the morning and shave, I wouldn't take it that far but it is definatly a great razor, my frien just read his list of goals for the futrure to me as I was writting this, and one of them was to travel and see dave for a year, dave mathews, I couldn't agree more. what is it about his music that is so unbelievable, sometimes his lyrics don't make sense, but the whole band is so musically inclined and can just jam and do things at the drop of a hat that most other bands can't do, they just know each other so well. I looked at the clock and it hasn't been 00 minutes yet, come to think about I don't really sit around with a lot of things on my mind,  I am in a house with five guys so usually there is someone to talk to someone to talk to some one to talk to some one to talk to , no one to talk to right now and even if there was I couldn't because I can't type and talk at the same time I would type what I was talking or talk what I was writing, whatever, how can drummers carry on so many different beats at the smae time, somethimes two with their feet and two with their hands while singinglyrics, amazing, I play a little guitar , but when I try to strum and sing I get thrown off, not comfortable enough with the guitar yet though, I probably never will be though, I just got interupted and my train of thought  was ruined but I guess it isn't important, I think that assigments like this are interesting. not so much for the researcher but for the person writing. like me, I never really thought about what I think about. This is forcing me to do that. I am scared that the weather will never get back to normal- why wont it be cold where it is supposed to be cold?  I have a friend in LOCNAME and he says that it did not snow there at all this winter, what is that?  Another thing that worries me is anal people?  Didn't Freud study those kind of people. One of the guys I live with is so anal that it hurts me to watch him worry about all of his stuff. He asked me today if I knew what happened to two of his hot dog buns and he asked me the other day if I knew if someone drank any of his milk because he noticed that someone had moved it. I don't know what is more sad about that. that he noticed or that he cared. I think that we should bring him in and study him for our class. What can we do with this kind of illness kind of thing- you know what I mean. That may have to be an entire unique number of its own- \"upper division standing required\" if you know what I mean. I am collecting loose change, it sits in a clear glass jar next to my monitor- I would guess that I have about 00 dollars in right now- you can't have a dime. \nAsnwer:"
