I guess I can say I've had experience with this in that I used to, and still do sometimes, write down stuff when I just had to get something off my chest. I followed my thoughts and emotions. It helped me a lot to get through some things. I had never really done anything like that until this past summer. I guess it was because I hadn't had anything bother me so much until then. But anyhow, I am not about to tell you about my experience; that is personal. I find it strange that I never really liked to write, assignments for example. I found it so boring and pointless. But now I realize that many authors write for pleasure, for entertainment, or to simply get something off their chest. But I guess you learn as you go. So far I feel I'm doing ok in following my thoughts, which have been pretty much superficial. Anyhow, I'm here completing an assignment, and complete it I shall. Besides, there are no right or wrong answers. Now, I'm just looking at the keyboard because my mind has gone blank. I thought this assignment would be easier for me seeing that I've had experience in writing my thought without planning ahead, but I didn't think I would have this much problems in having a subject to write. I just thought of something. It is something I had thought about during the summer, while I was going through the experience mentioned before. I feel that many people skip the thought process and just act with what they feel. I do agree that it is important to satisfy your emotions, your feelings, and your desires, but there must also be some thought put into a decision. Without this thinking process, a person could get him or herself into a lot of trouble. For example, if for some reason Person A decides he feels like killing someone, he could get into a lot of trouble for doing it. If he thinks about it ahead of time, he will see the dark road ahead. He will realize that he is just being crazy and that satisfying his feelings could cost a lot. And yet, I find it hard to believe that some people, some of whom I know personally, don't use this process. Take for example many teenagers. They got out with friends. They get drunk and end up crashing and in the hospital, if they are lucky to be alive. Had they thought about the consequences, chances are they would have realized that getting drunk was not worth it. But then, there is also an \"evaluation\" that takes place when this thinking process is used. In the case of the teenagers, they are probably aware of the consequences of getting drunk and driving. I mean, they see it everyday through various media. They probably realize that the consequences are pretty bad; yet they choose to go ahead and drink. They are willing to take the risk. They have decided that getting drunk is more important, or at least worth the risk, than their lives. It's probably that stage in their lives when they feel immortal. When they feel invincible. I was a teenager once, but never did I do the things that many others did and still do. I consider my life to precious to waste on one party. I have just made an evaluation after the thought process. I have found throughout the years that I tend to hold myself back on certain actions. I feel like doing something, I want to do it, but yet, my mind says \"Stop. Is it right?  Is it good for you?  Is it ethical?\"  etc. , etc. I consider many things before actually making a decision. Although my feelings and desires might be held back for a while, I know that at least my life remains the \"right\" track. You will notice that my college experience will be a little different from other students. Twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds have gone by, so I guess that's time. Hope you enjoyed!!! \nAsnwer:"
