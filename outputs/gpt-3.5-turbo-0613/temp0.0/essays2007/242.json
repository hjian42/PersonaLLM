No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: After the first day ORGNAME class, I went to my dorm room and tried to sit down and do this assignment. To my luck, I was unable to get connected to this address. Oh well. my sister id talking to me right now. she actually thinks I\u2019m listening to her. I guess that is why I am a theater major. right now she's reading me The Principal from the LOCNAME LOCNAME. My sister is a special education teacher in LOCNAME, LOCNAME. We are at my mom's elementary school, in her office. She happens to be a Principal. The reason I\u2019m back at home this fine labor day weekend is because I was unfortunate enough to be born in September. Yes I am still seventeen. Back to what I was thinking about. oh yeah I am home now because I need to have my parent's permission to do the experimental research for this class. I am going back to school on Monday. I feel bad leaving my room in such a mess, but my roommate went to fort worth to visit her best friend at ORGNAME. PROPNAME is her name. She is not having such a grand time at school so she convinced PROPNAME, my roommate, to go up there and visit her. Well I only have ten minutes left to type. I am so glad you don't plan to read these assignments because the typographical errors are plentiful. My sister is such a dork. she is singing everything that she would normally speak. She graduated from the ORGNAME of ORGNAME. (along with her husband)  She keeps asking me if I am excited about going to school at LOCNAME. Of course I am. She wishes she had majored in Theatre. Don't get me wrong she loves teaching, but her first love was the theatre. I need to get organized. I still haven't called my friends to go hang out with them, and I have been home for a couple of days now. I have no idea why I haven't called. Maybe it's because I know I have a lot of things to do such as homework, or laundry, or last minute items to buy from ORGNAME. It has nothing to do with not wanting to see them. I guess well I don't know . I guess that's why I am in this psychology class. I always wanted to take psychology in high school, but I never had time to take in my schedule. The psychology teacher was also my honors English teacher my sophomore year. She was a pretty cool lady. Well twenty minutes have passed and as much as I would like to continue chatting with you, but I have a lot of other homework to do. I am also very tired. I stayed up half the night . IT was a sad night learning of Princess PROPNAME's death. I have the chills.  \nAsnwer:"
