No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: right now it is 0:00 and I am suppose to write for twenty minutes. this shouldn't be hard, so ill just write exactly what comes to my mind. I'm sitting in one of the guys on my halls room. so I may make some references to what he is saying. Today was a very tiring day. i went to bed at nine last night and couldnt get up. i think I just over slept. I was excited to see my best friend for dinner tonight. he can always make me laugh and put a smile on my face. i need to get my hair cut when I go home this weekend. and I need to go shopping for my brother before I get home. its his birthday on sat. i am not sure what I need to get him. hes so easy to shop for but I want to get him something he will really like. My dad and my brother came in this weekend and I was so happy to see them. i only wish I knew if he were saved. i gave him a card last week in the mail asking him if he was because I wanted to know if he would be with me in heaven when all is said and done. and he still hasn't responded to the card. i hope I didnt scare him or make him feel uncomfortable. i just wish he would understand how awesome God is. he has done so much for me. and I just wish my dad would let God bless him as well. all I know is that without God. i would not make it through every day. I'm really blessed that the people I hang out with are strong Christians. i just hope that I am a strong influence on those who don't know Christ. I'm really glad I get to see my mom and sister this weekend . i miss them so much. I need to start managing my time better soon. or I am going to be far behind in my classes. i also need to start running again. its been about four days since I last ran. not good. I have no idea what to write next. but give me a minute and something will come to mind. i hope I'm thinking but what I'm writing is all I am thinking about. ok this past weekend some of my friends came up and it was good to see them. except one girl used two towels while she was here. i could of shot her. she doesn't understand that I am in college and as stupid as it sounds I don't have towels coming out my ears. and I have to wash them. and it cost money to wash living in the dorm. which I love there is always something to do here. its so much fun. there is never a dull moment. i only get annoyed when some girls down the hall yell and scream like they are haveing the time of their life all the time. it really starts to bug. i don't know I'm listing to this guy whose room I'm in talk on the phone so that is what is in my mind now. i can't wait tomorrow I start impulse. a freshman bible study on campus. i hope to meet some more life long friends there. iv really enjoyed this class so far. its fun and interesting. i have two minutes left to write. this really wasnt a hard assignment. it was easier than I thought. and kind of neat. i guess its almost time for me to start the next one. just a few more seconds and I'm done. ok anytime now. a minute seems a lot longer when you think it should be over. ok its over. \nAsnwer:"
