The first one was alright but I don't know if I would like living in a duplex. What if they are annoying or out of control? I liked the second house a lot more. It was huge and nicely kept but it was a little pricey. We would definately need at least like 0-0 people to live with us to bring down the price. It'd be cool if PROPNAME and Singer would live with us but I don't know if their parents would like the idea of them living with guys. It would definately hook us up for meeting girls and what not. Better parties for sure. I'm so tired, getting up early for that stupid ticket drawing that got sold out really sucked. And now we don't even have tickets so we woke up early for nothing. I have so much reading to do in all my classes but I know i'll be fine. I need to call kathy back too. I wish she could have stayed up here longer but that's not possible so there's no reason to dwell on it. I wish i had more time to take a nap before our next meeting with the other realtor. But i am pretty excited to see some more houses. Supposedly there's a nice one across from the frat which would be ideal. We need one close to campus too because i don't know if i can afford a car next year. I'm going to have to find myself a big paying job this summer. Damn my head is killing me. I really should try to take a nap. I'm really pissed about my phone. I don't understand how a top of the line phone can lose its battery in 00 minutes of use when it's supposed to have 0. 0 hrs worth of talk time. If this new battery doesnt work im going to lose it. I don't have the patience to be dealing with this crap. I need to take a shower before i leave tonite because there won't be any time before the party i don't think. Why does my room not get any cooler. I'm sweating and im just sitting here typing. I have a horrible taste in my mouth, i should go brush my teeth or rinse my mouth with listerine. How have only 0. 0 minutes passed. I'm starting to get a little tired here. I really didnt like that first realtor. He kept rushing us and stuff and he just seemed annoying. But if he has the house we want i won't deny him the business. My blisters finally healed so wearing those boots won't kill me anymore. My cold is starting to go away too which is good. I hope PROPNAME is taking good notes in chem because i just couldnt make it today. Way too tired. Whatever i'll give her a call when class is over and see how things went. It's not a bad class its just really basic and easy stuff right now that i remember from high school. Plus it is a pretty long walk. Ok 0 minutes to go, not too bad. I'm pretty hungry now that i think about it. I would love some spicy wings from pluckers. But i have to cut down on expenses so there goes that thought. PROPNAME was hilarious today when we were trying to get donations for charity. I couldnt stop laughing. That was fun. I need to get my plane ticket for winter break. They are so damn expensive even though it's so far away. I should do that today or tomorrow so that they don't get any worse. OK 0 more minutes it's almost over. My fingers are starting to cramp up a bit. And my hunger keeps growing so i hope these minutes go by fast. I hope everyone still takes the bus to dallas for the game because at leat that will be fun. PROPNAME said we may be able to stay in her when we go so that would be a sweet deal too. PROPNAME just got out of the shower. I need to take one too. I need to do some laundry as well soon becaus my basket is starting to fill up. I got to find someone to do it with so its not so boring. OK im too hungry i need something to eat now. Twenty minutes is definately longer than i thought but i guess it is almost over. About 0 minute to go. . nice. PROPNAME got some really cool things to hang in our room today. Definately gives the room some more character. 00 seconds left. 00 seconds left. 00 seconds. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0 bye  \nAsnwer:"
