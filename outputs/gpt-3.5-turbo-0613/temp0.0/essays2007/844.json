I had to find my friend PROPNAME a date for Lion Hunt that is in 0 weeks. It was so hard because he lives back home and no one knows him  Thank goodness thid girl that lives in my dorm said thath she would go. I have a ton of pre cal homework to do ajnd I have no idea how to do it. I 'm hoping taht this will help me get rid of sone stress. I went to go look for a cell phone today and all the deals are pretty crappy. My shoulders really hurt this chair is probably too low and this is a lap top and I don't like typing on it because the key board is in the middle so your arms don't bend. Oh well there wouldn't have been enough room in here for a big computer. This room is so small. I feel do cramped and like I don't have any privacy ecept now because my roomate is not here right now. Our room is so dirty and I am so sick of it I just want everything to get cleaned up. But of course we don't have enough room. Well, I don't know what elsse to write. I have an 0 o clock class in the morning  That sucks. I have to get up way early in the morning. PROPNAME, my roomate, doesn't have class until 00 o colock in the morning. I can't forget to turn in money for my dues to the sorority house. I have a meeting tomorrow so hopefully I will remember. That'll be another item off my chest. I am so lost in anthroplogy. I wish I could understand. I've also got a speech to write and rehearse on thursday so I can give it on friday. that makes me nervous because there is only 0 other freshman in my class, but its not like you can really tell the difference that much so maybe everybody that knows will havbe forgotten that I am a fish. It sounds so weird that I am  a freshman again. I'm having fun though. Austin is way different than wichita Falls. I went home lastr weekend and the KA party was so much more lame than the parties we have here. I 'm glad that I still am not at home like 00% of my friends are. I can't wait for tommy and jacob to come down . They'll be here in 0 weeks. YEA!  I sure am getting tired of typing and personally I annot wait for these 00 minutes be over because I need to do my precal amd then go to bed I have an early, long day ahead of me . Mondays and Wednesdays are the longest days for me. I basically am in class formn 0-0. Well, Its been 00 minutes now time for me tog og and finish all my fun stuff. \nAsnwer:"
