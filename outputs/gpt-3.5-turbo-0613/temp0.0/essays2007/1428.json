I haven't come home from going out every night until 0am and I think my roommate is getting really upset with me. I feel bad because she never goes out and when I tell her I'm going out I think she feels left out. I am going to start inviting her. We knew each other in high school and now we're living together which is kind of weird but it's working out really well. People always told me not to room with my friend because you will end up hating each other but it's been working so far. She is one of those motherly typesshe likes cleaning and looking after meit's fun. I just broke up with my boyfriend of 0 years last weekend. That was really tough because we were so close. He doesn't go to ORGNAME so that was making it really difficult. I miss him. I am dating this guy now that went to my high school but he graduated a year earlier. He's really cool and we get along but it isn't the same. We'll just see how it works out. I miss my family. I am so used to seeing them everyday and now that I don't it's weird. I was so ready to get out of the house but now that I am officially out it's sad. I feel so old. I have to be independent which stinks. When I first got here, my computer wasn't working so I had to take it to the repair place and I got it all set up by myselfit works nowobviously. That was kind of liberating, though. Doing something important by yourself. I was the kind of kid who never ordered by herself at the restaurant. I always had my mom do it. So, coming to college and figuring stuff out by myself is really weird. I haven't had much homework lately. I thought college was really tough and so far it really hasn't been. My roommate has tons of homework every night and I just haven't. I feel like I am missing out on the college experience. Today, I am going to College Station to visit my friend. We are going to see PROPNAME PROPNAME in concert which will be totally awesome. I love PROPNAME PROPNAME. My roommate is going to the Dave Matthews Concert in DallasI am jealous. she has been home every weekendthat's probably not healthy. Her boyfriend is still back home so she misses him a lot. I think she needs to stay here at least one weekend in between the times she goes home. I don't really think she is homesickjust bored. Austin is such a great citypeople always told me that once you go to Austin you won't want to leave. I can see how that can happen. There's always something to do. I am starting to run out of things to talk aboutI think my 00 minutes are almost over. I found somethingthe Freshman 00. I am not going to gain thatbut, I can definitely see how that happens. You definitely have more spare time in college than we did in high school. I was really busy in high school. I was on drill team and I had practice every night until 0. I didn't have much time to myself. Now I do. I get bored. My dad just got a new car. It's weird that he has a new car and I've never seen it. My little sister had her 00th bday yesterday and she told my momwhen is sara coming home? My mom said, she lives three hours away, she can't come home tonight because she'll have to drive back for class the next day. When my mom told me that I started crying because it hasn't hit my little sister yet that I moved out. We used to not be close but we are nownow that we are growing up. Well, my 00 minutes are upit's been nice talking to you. \nAsnwer:"
