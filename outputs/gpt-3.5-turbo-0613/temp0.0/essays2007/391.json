No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I wonder if the twenty minutes is what they're grading for because I type so slow they'll probably think I only wrote e for five minutes  I didn't realize the assignments were due today I thought they were due tomorrow, oh well I wonder if that means if I have to0 finish that damn pretest. I guess so          that girl has some funky hair, I can't even type without having to look up    its just like bam!!! in front of me,  I need a computer at home so I don't have to come to the library all the time. I don't get much done at home though so many distractions   what can I make for dinner there s nothing to eat at home, maybe kimchi cheegae  but I made that two times already maybe robert got some groceries,   we need some onion and garlic otherwise I can't really make much   oh shit I need a rice cooker still before I can go and make all this  maybe I'll invite PROPNAME over to eat. yeah I wonder when her classes are even over. yeah I can just tell her to bring her rice cooker over and I'll cook,     she will probably want to eat Korean food anyway because I'm pretty sure that the Dobie food can't be that good. if it is at all like the jester food, that stuff gives me the runs. I don't know  maybe they put supplements in it to reach nutritional guidelines  but whatever it is it is not any good for me. the jester people must get used to it part of their body's way off adapting to a new nutritional source. nutrigrain bars are awesome. I'm so damn hungry. they should have a cafe here in the ORGNAME so those late night studies can have some refreshment lemonade  that's what I want it's funny how me and Angela have so much in common I bet she is thinking lemonade right now. I wonder what PROPNAME thinks of her?   that would be fucked up if they were both lying to me. I guess I just have to trust him. I've known him for so long but sometimes you'd do fucked up things for a girl, I couldn't blame him either because I've done such before also. I regret it of course. this guy told me not to ever regret something you've done because if you keep doing that then it is like you're asking back everything you done in you're life. so you may as well not ever be living it. I didn't even really know him we were just fishing next to each other and ha was old, I wish I could go fishing right now. it relaxes me and all this stuff is stressing me and I need to relax. I guess I could go fishing in freshwater but that can't beat the sun nothing can beat fishing the surf of san PROPNAME pass all night even if you don't catch anything just being there when this sky turns purple then blue then a whole myriad of colors that you can't even describe from yellow to black     and than the sun comes and you make your last couple of casts not even caring really to catch a fish kind of a solute to the sun for thanking whatever you caught or didn't catch for next time.  ok that's been about thirty minutes and I'm going all philosophical I think I'm done \nAsnwer:"
