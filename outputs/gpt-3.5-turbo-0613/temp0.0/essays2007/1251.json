Today has been a busy day, I got a lot of things done that I needed to so that is kind of a relief. I am really stressed out right now so I am trying to organize what I need to get done in my head. I finally get to move into my new home tomorrow after class. I have been homeless for the past month. The past few weeks I've been staying with friends but it really sucks not having a place of your own. I feel really disorganized right now and I hate to start the school year out that way. The next few days are going to be busy moving in. I got UT vs. OU tickets today. That's one thing I don't have to worry about anymore. But now I need to get that trip organized. Casey, PROPNAME, LOCNAME, and C. J. have all committed. I need at least one more person to commit so the hotel room won't be too expensive. That shouldn't be hard though so I am not going to think about that now. I really want to go running right now but it's the middle of the day and really hot. I think I might go anyways. Then I'll come back and shower, pick up Casey from class at 0:00, and start getting ready to go out. The band we're going to see starts at 0. That is going to start the night out early. But, I guess that is a good thing because then it will end early, which means more sleep before class in the morning. I am listening to some music right now that makes me want to dance! What sucks is that I can't dance though. I wonder why God gives some people rhythm and some not. I hate not having rhythm because I love music. People say that everyone can dance, just do it, but I am proof that that is not true. Oh well. I need to get over that. My neck hurts, I guess I slept on it wrong. I hate it when I have a crick in my neck. I really feel like running today. I wonder why. Running dancing where is all this energy coming from? I haven't gotten much sleep in the past couple days. I think my body does better when I don't get as much sleep. When I sleep late I feel depressed that I wasted part of the day and I am still tired. Today I woke up early and I feel productive. Let's see what all I did. I went early and tried to draw football tickets. They told me to come back later so I went back to my friend's place and called my mom. I made a dentist appointment which is long overdue, drove to my storage place and paid a bill, found out I could move in tomorrow at 0:00, bought a few CDs I've been wanting, went out to eat for lunch, and then went and got the football tickets. Now I am doing some homework. Next I am going to run, hopefully not die of a heat stroke, then tonight I have a ticket to see a band play I have been wanting to see. That will be fun. I thought about taking a nap but it doesn't look like that is going to happen. I guess I'll just have a couple cups of coffee before I start drinking some beers. Well, it looks like my time is up. This assignment reminds me of my emails to my friends. I just sit down and type whatever comes out and they end up being really long, boring, and pointless. Kind of nice I get to do it for a grade and not annoy my friends. Peace out. \nAsnwer:"
