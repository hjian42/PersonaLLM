I find it very hard just to sit down and study. As a Freshmen, I have found many new experiences in the past week. Finally getting my email hooked up, I received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week. My good friend from home wrote me from LOCNAME LOCNAME. She informed me of great news. She is having a ball at her new school. She is on the drill team, and making many new friends. Which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday(sunday). As I came home from church, I was excited to see that I had two messages all for me! :)  The first one is from a friend who attends ORGNAME. The other was from my best friend, who sadly is going to another college in LOCNAME. We could only talk for about fifteen minutes, which wasn't enough time. However, it was long enough so I could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends. Which leads me to the point that I am feeling terribly lonely. I don't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes, but I am envious. See, I came to LOCNAME because I didn't want to go to ORGNAME because my brother went there. UT and ORGNAME were the only two schools which I applied. Truthfully, I am not too excited about coming here. However, I don't want to go to A&M. It's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home. Anyway, so I moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud. So I have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home!  I am always here all by myself. I have a total of four friends up here. One of which, PROPNAME, I spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views. She knows how to get under my skin. However, we are closer than any of my other friends up here. Which leads to the final three. PROPNAME goes to PROPNAME PROPNAME, and is so homesick. She misses her boyfriend and her mother, which is understandable. PROPNAME is a nice and wonderful, but we haven't spent too much time together, and PROPNAME. PROPNAME I've known since the seventh grade and didn't talk to her much my junior and senior years. You see her and PROPNAME are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking, so me being the insincere person which I am takes PROPNAME's side. My reasoning was because I thought PROPNAME was inconsiderate of others needs. You see, I had every single class with her our Sophomore year, and we kind of got tired of each other. So back to the present. I don't really know anybody, and I am bad at meeting people because I don't know what to say. Don't think I'm quite or shy because that's far from it, but I just don't know how to go up to people and strike up a conversation. Which leaves me very lonely. It's mainly my fault because I don't want to spend much time with PROPNAME because we just know the right way to almost kill each other. PROPNAME, who is great and there really isn't a good excuse except I don't really feel connected(is that stupid?) PROPNAME, who is so homesick that she doesn't want to do anything. And PROPNAME, who called me yesterday just to talk. Now how nice is that?  I mean, I went to PROPNAME's today before class, and I had fun. She's nice, not to mention beautiful, skinny, and very smart(very. )  Which I guess why I used to have bad feelings towards her. She's invited me to do stuff with her and her new friends(which she made) but I kind of want to meet my own friends. I group of new friends. Also, PROPNAME the homesick one made friends too. Which is good, because she needs to be happy. However, I think it is about time for me to make some friends. Well, also I tried out for the ballet class here. It sucks!  I'm so mad. There are two classes a freshmen class and an intermediate. I was stuck in the freshmen class. It is so bad. I've taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight. Not to mention there is no pointe here!  I am not trying to sound smug, because I was far from being the best at my studio at home. But these girls are beginners, and some of the stuff we are doing is so elementary. Don't get me wrong, I was going to use this to my own benefit and work on techinque, but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of a combination, to tell us were to \"place our arm on the barre\"  I almost died. I know where to put it. I don't need help with that. I need help with my turnout, extension, balance!  NOT WITH WERE TO PUT MY ARM ON THE BARRE!  Well, as you can see I am not excactly a happy camper. I'm glad I wrote this, it was fun. My fingers feel like they are going to fall off, but I'm sure I need to get used to that. Well, I'm going home this weekend to go see a ballet my company puts on. It's PROPNAME and the PROPNAME. We've done it before. It's going to be cute. I was the Duck, my friend PROPNAME(who goes to LOCNAME LOCNAME) was the Bird. She was a great dancer. She was strong and very precise, she danced the lead in the Nutcracker(not PROPNAME, but the ORGNAME ORGNAME)  she shared it with PROPNAME who dance the Cat. PROPNAME is a beautiful dancer she has such grace. She was going to go to LOCNAME on a scholarship, but she ruptured her disc and can't dance for a year, so she stayed home. My other good friend is PROPNAME, she's a sophomore. She is very good because she was dancing with all of us who are two years older. So those are all of my wonderful friends in ballet. I love ballet, we also have this one dancer named PROPNAME, she has extension to die for. That means her leg goes all the way to her ear. She is great. I love ballet, that makes me so happy. Well, thanks for this assignment, I'll see you in class, but I doubt you'll see me!  I'll probably drop by you office sometime!  I hope this makes since! \nAsnwer:"
