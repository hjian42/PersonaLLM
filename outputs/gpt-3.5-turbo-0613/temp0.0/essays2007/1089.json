He's coming out here next semester from LOCNAME. It's going to make everything a lot harder. My parents said that they would stop supporting me when I move in with him. I will have to go to work full time as well as being a full time student. I am willing to work really hard to be with PROPNAME but I just can't see that this would be the best thing for my future. Or maybe it is. Who really knows. It's hard for me to live without him and I don't want money (or lack of) to ever get in the way of love in my life. That would feel really wrong. I can do it. Ok this is what I believe. I need to take a chance on love, no matter what my parents or anyone says. The responsibility is all left on me though. My interpersonal communications class is really teaching me a lot about our relationship. I love that class. It really intrigues me. This is such a weird stage in my life. I have no idea what comes next. So much change is all happening at once and I don't know where it will all lead to. My life could take so many different paths and it should be interesting to see what happens. I miss my family so much. Especially my little sister. I have this strange fear of loosing my sister. She is so important to me. But this is normal. So why should I even be thinking about loosing her? I think it stems from the fact that my dad lost his sister (also his only sibling) at the age of 00. He hasn't really discussed it with me but I think that the experience of loosing PROPNAME had such a profound effect on his life. He has always had depression problems but I have never known why. But I have always thought of my dad of not liking his life. And maybe I am afraid of falling into those same things I think of his life. When I think about it realistically, I don't see any particular reason that I would loose PROPNAME but that's just it. My father didn't see it coming either. PROPNAME was alone in the house and she started a fire with an iron and she burnt in the fire. So I guess that's what I'm afraid of; that without any warning or sign or anythingshe could just be gone. I love you PROPNAME! \nAsnwer:"
