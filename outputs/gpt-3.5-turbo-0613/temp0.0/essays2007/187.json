All I want is for  something to go right!  I tried to dot his paper about thirty seconds ago but it didn't work because again I've messed something up! I was talking about this in my last stream of consciousness paper that I thought was gone but realized after I had erased half o of it that it was really still there! AAhhh!  Can something please go right?   My Ethernet card was not properly packaged and is causing me and a few others serious drama because we've all been trying to make it work for four days now. I don't even know if I'm supposed to push enter when I get near the end of the line but I figure better safe than sorry as far as grades go. I just looked at the clock and I've only been writing for four minutes. Why does time go  by so slowly when it counts. Speaking of timing, mine is the worst!  I always like guys either before or after they like me but never while they like me. Whenever I like a guy I'm to shy, stupid, scared,  immature to let him know, and by the time or if he likes me I have lost interest!  Or they never have interest in the first place and I find that challenging and will pursue that guy instead  of the  one who likes me!  Or in one case I'll find out that after liking me four two straight years, he decides to change sex preferences when I like him. AHHH!  Actually I had my chance and now I'll have to live with regret forever, or until he wants an opposite sex relationship!  Ten minutes to go and I'm running out of self-deprecating and embarrassing stories of my miserable unromantic life! I want someone who respects the fact that I'm not a traditional female and that likes my odd sense of humor and is also funny himself and finds me attractive. . Which reminds me as I look above my roommate\u2019s computer of another guy who I let slip through the cracks Even though there was a slim chance of anything ever happening, I never acted on my feelings,  Wait a minute I did spill my guts while playing truth or dare with him and other friends. I wish I could play truth or dare with the other guy I like(d) so that he'll know that it was me and not him that kept us ;apart, I liked you then and I liked you up until I found out there was no chance for us and I resented you a little!  Someday I'll get up the courage to tell him!  It is about twenty degrees Fahrenheit in my lovely room in LOCNAME LOCNAME on the tenth floor. The air Conditioning vent is blowing right in my face as I type. I have been having stomach problems all day, and they are starting to resurface,  I almost passed  out at the draw for the football game against ORGNAME this Saturday, I refuse to paint my face half orange and half white as my roommate hopes I will. One minute to go and I'm starting to feel relieved that I wont have to think about this particular assignment ever again. Five percent of my grade is secured and pretty soon I'll be doing those psych experiments and that will be easy too. I'm majoring in psychology but I used to want to be an architect. Oops, I got carried away and wrote one minute over, now it is two. \nAsnwer:"
