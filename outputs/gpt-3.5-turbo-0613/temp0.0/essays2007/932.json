No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am so glad to be home this weekend but at the same time I really feel like crying right now. I don't know what is wrong with me . I don't want to go back to school I really hate it there. I really just wish that I could make some friends it seems like everyone already has made new friends and they don't want any more. I just can't be the type of person to go uot and meet new people. but I may not even be here next semester so what is the point of making friends if I will be at a different school in a month. atleast I have PROPNAME there with me at school I am only happy when I am with him but I can't be with him all the time I have got to live my own life. he says that if I hate the dorm so much that I should move in with him but I am really scared to , I think because I am afraid he will get tired of me. iam also worried that if I change schools next semester that he will give upo on us and want to be with someone that he has there with him all the time. he says that he doesn't want me to leave and I believe him buthim saying that is really unfair to what I want. I am just not happy there at school and he shouldn't want me to stay there just because it makes him happy. atleast things are better now than they were when I first moved to austin . I know that I cried a lot and it was probably annoying but carrye didnt have to yell at me about it she is my friend and my roommate and she should understnad that the transistion to college is not that easy for everyone. I am scared to talk to her about anything because I am afraid she is going tro jump down my throat again. I wish I was good at talking back to people and that I wouldnt let everyone walk all over me . but I can't help it I don't know what to say to people when they trake advantage of me. I don't want to make them mad at me but what can I say . the few times that I did talk back they embarrass me by making it seem like my fault, and like I am freaking out. why are people so mean. I am so ready to just be married and have a job and live my life and not have to follow everyone's rules no one seems to understnd me but hey thats ok I don't even understand myself. I just want to be happy and I am not happy right now and now that I am home I want to go back to school because I feel to growm up and mature for my friends that are here. I will figure it all out one day  \nAsnwer:"
