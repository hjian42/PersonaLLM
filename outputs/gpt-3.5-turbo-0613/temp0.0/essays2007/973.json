After the meeting, we went to this show where this guy hypnotized people. It was so funny!  Some of my pledge sisters where some of the subjects. It was hillarious to see them and the funny things he made them do. I can't believe I waited until now to write this. I'm usually the type of person who gets things done ahead of time. I think all of this freedom makes me feel like I have nothing to do. I missed a homework assighnment in Kinesiology the other day. I couldn't believe it. Tomorrow we're going to have this \"relationship talk\" with the Delts. It's going to be really fun, I can't wait. This time is going by really slowly, I just know that I'm going to run out of stuff to say. I'm really hungry, I haven't eaten since 0:00. I've noticed that I eat more often now. I think it's because I work out (or try to) three times a week. I always feel so much better when I work out. Hopefully, I'll be able to keep it up for the rest of the year. The dreaded \"freshman fifteen\"  is not going to get me!  This Thursday, I have a meeting with my doctor about my knee. It's been giving me problems. I had surgery on it last October. The crappy thing is that my other knee is starting to feel the same way. God, why was I born with ghetto knees?  Okay, I feel like I've been writing forever and it's onlt been 00 minutes. I am dreading all of the writing I'm going to have to do next semester. English is going to suck next semester!  I've never been any good at English. I don't enjoy it in the least bit. On the other hand, I love this psychology class!  Every day I get to come, I look forward to it. Our professor is hilarios. I don't know what it is that makes him such an awesome teacher, he just is. Every day, I come home and tell my roommate all that we discussed that day. I enjoy reading our textbook, I actually find the information interesting!  (much unlike my other classes)  I wish Psychology was a more job-promising field. I would definately look into it if it was. Okay, five more minutes, I think I can BS my way through it!  I'm waiting on my this guy PROPNAME to call me. I'm not sure what exactly he is to me. We're dating, and we wouldn't date anyone else, but I feel funny calling him my boyfriend. Okay, my roomate just blared the TV. If I did that while she was trying to do homework, she would eat my head off!!!!!  Okay this last minute will be used to sign off. I wish all of my writing assignments were this easy!  There, D-O-N-E! \nAsnwer:"
