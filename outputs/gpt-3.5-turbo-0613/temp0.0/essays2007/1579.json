No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: ok i have been a little nervous about this assignment, not too nervous but a little. i'm kind of a quiet person so writing my thoughts for twenty minutes is a little intimidating. i don't really like how a lot of the stuff we do in psychology is over the internet. i guess it's convenient, but the internet messes up a lot. it is working today though. i just bought tickets for jimmy eat world over the internet. they are one of my favorite bands. my best friend, PROPNAME, is coming up here to go to the concert with me. i miss her a lot! i need to clean my room. courtney, my roommate, has cleaned up a little. i don't think she cares too much that i am messy. she's messy too. she is from my hometown, so i knew her before we lived together here. we are getting really close. i'm glad we decided to live together. i'm glad i didn't wait til the last minute to do this assignment. i need to do my calculus and physics homework too. i also need to, well i don't need to but i want to go get a DVD called waking life. it is really good. it is a movie that makes me think because it questions reality. i like movies like that. i've been thinking about doing stuff with movies as a career, like visual arts type stuff, but that's only if i don't get into the architecture department. i need to take this psychology course because i will need to know how colors affect people's emotions if i am going to major in interior design. that really intrests me. i need to call kristina and tell her that i got the jimmy eat world tickets. she was at my friend jory's house the last time i talked to her. i miss jory a lot too. i haven't seen her in a long time. me and kristina and jory have been friends for a long time, since seventh grade. i miss them a lot. i need to call my friend cherry too. she lives in oklahoma because that's where she is going to college. i have about four minutes left. i hope this is the kind of stuff you wanted us to write. i guess it is because this is what i'm thinking about. i hope it doesn't matter that i didn't capitalize the word   i.  i never do even when i write unless it is in a paper i need to turn in for english class. my senior english teacher is a really nice lady. i really admire her. she is very encouraging. i miss her too. bye          \nAsnwer:"
