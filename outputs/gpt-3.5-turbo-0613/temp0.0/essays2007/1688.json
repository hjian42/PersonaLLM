No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      Why do people always seem to stress out over the most petty   and unimportant things? It seems as though when we leave the   mundane routine of college life and enter the college atmosphere   that our perceptions and opinions of people and things become all   the more important. When my roommate and I went shopping at the   LOCNAME mall this weekend these petty issues seemed ever present.  Girls shopping beside us charging obscene amounts of money   onto daddy's credit cards. Have many teens forgotten about the   value and importance of money? I also this weekend began to   wonder why some guys are so hung up on their appearances and   homophobic. My new friend PROPNAME happens to be fixated on getting   dates/girlfriend and there is this guy in his complex who really likes   him. The entire time at the mall PROPNAME asked my roommate and I if   random people were   hotter   than he was. This relentless insecurity   and constant echo of self degredation was honestly quite draining.  Why can't people just accept that they are who they are and be happy   at that? Society's fixation on appearances and wealth have truly   begun to mask what is ultimately important in friendships and   relationships. Most people seek relationships on all levels with   people who share the same interests and personality traits that   support their own beliefs and that can reciprocate other ideas that   they themselves may not think on their own. Why is love and   relationships always such a larghe chunk of a teen's life. I myself   have realized recently that I've spent a great many years in   relationships loving someone and being loved in return. We as a   society place so much emphasis on dating, relationships, and   marriage that our thoughts and actions always seemed aimed at   such goals. I mean look at the fixation that many college age   individuals have on dating shows. In high school many an AP   Calculus class were spent discussing Elimidate and the trashy or   sexy guys/girls that were on the particular episode. I myself admit to   watching the trash, but for some reason society has aimed my eye   to these sort of shows. Since I arrived on campus dorm life has truly   agreed with me. I worried for months that my roomate would be just   dreadful of that we would have little to nothing in common.  Fortunately, my roommate and I have a great deal in common and   are turning out to be great friends. The University has also provided   me with many unexpected opportunities. Besides the rec center, I'm   signing up for rock climbing, the music school has turned out to be   unexpectedly positive. I have played the violin since I was 0 years old   . In the past year I have realinzed that I genuinely desired to teach   music in elementary school. When I arrived at LOCNAME on the first day of   school I was terrified of auditioning for the UT Symphony orchestra.  When I arrived outside of professor PROPNAME's office I was greeted by   many unfamiliar faces of musicians much older than me. My nerves   seemed to overwhelm me as I walked in the room. All I could think   about was trying not to rush or let my nerves get the best of me. I felt   that the audition went well but I was forced to wait the entire   weekend for the results. As it turned out my audition had gone as   well as I had felt. I was seated 00th chair in the orchestra in the 0st   violin section. I can't wait for tomorrow to start yet another exciting   adventure in my college career and meet more new and exciting   people. Alas, I have to go to work and spend my entire weekend   hosting, babysitting, and waiting tables. Hopefully everyone will   come home from college on Friday so we can catch up on all the   new happenings and just relax and enjoy each other's company. \nAsnwer:"
