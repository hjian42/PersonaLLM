I am very excited about doing this assignment because I just received my email account. The whole technology thing really amazes me. I am very excited about taking this class because I am interested in the study of people and how their minds work. I am a little undecided on my major, and who knows:  this may be my calling. Well, maybe!  This is very fun for me being here on the world wide web. I feel like I've been in the dark for so long. I'm sitting here wondering what the people around me are doing?  Are they browsing or doing actual work. My guess is that they're doing important stuff, like I am doing. I'm looking forward to exploring other websites after this because like I said this is my first time on line. Now I can talk to my international friends and actually be in contact with my professors and teaching assistants. I have no idea how I made it through a whole year without an account. I guess that's why I missed a lot of posted assignments. O. K. now my hands are getting tired because it's been a whole summer since I've actually done work. But let me tell you it was a pretty exciting summer. I saw friends that I haven't seen in a while and had some wild and crazy times. I should have gone home to save money, but instead I stayed in a very expensive apartment on LOCNAME LOCNAME and spent all the money I worked so hard for on bills, etc. I am a waitress at Cafe PROPNAME's. It's a bit fun at times, and I make money on occasion. It really makes my whole opinion and view of people change. I mean, I really try to respect everyone for who they are, but when you're constantly waiting hand and foot on a bunch of stingy, angry people it kind of gets you down on people as a whole. It's a fun environment behind the scenes. I have some fun times with some great friends. We goof off and joke around, and we even hang out after work. I'll have to cut back on the hanging out part with school starting again. My boss thought it was a good idea to work me 00 hours this week. So, I'm pulling my hair out here. I'll tell her tomorrow that I cannot work this much while taking classes. I'll have a nervous breakdown. I do need the hours to pay bills, but I might be able to make it with only a few shifts a week. After all waitressing pays pretty good money when the business is there, you know. If all else fails, I'll beg my parents for a loan. whew now my hands are really tired. I realize that this is nothing compared to some of the stuff I will be writing; however, I still need to get warmed up for the semester. God, I can't wait until Christmas break. I love the holidays so much. I'm never in such a good mood as I am then, unless I have just been dumped by the man of my dreams which doesn't happen every year but it does and that is wh0y my feelings towards men is a very negative one. Actually I love the opposite sex, but at the same time I want to kill every one of them. Actually I am just waiting for Mr. PROPNAME and when I settle for Mr. alright for now that's when the crap hits the fan. Well it's been fun but my time's up. I guess I'll visit next time for assignment 0. Later! \nAsnwer:"
