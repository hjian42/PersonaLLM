No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: This is my first year here at the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME and I am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations. It is so hard for me because I have had to learn how to get around in such a large town, on such a huge campus, and living on my own for the first time is crazy. I have to find a job because I need to be able to pay my bills and I still have so much school work that I have to keep up with. At the ORGNAME ORGNAME I attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to. Here everything is done over the computer which I guess is good since we are in the electronic age, but I just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face. I miss my family, especially my sister. I moved here by myself and I really don't know anybody here in LOCNAME. I've never had to do so much walking in my life!  I guess I should get all the exercise that I need walking back and forth to my classes. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up in classes. I think I'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and I'm still very overwhelmed by all of it. I just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things. Twenty minutes is a long time to write. I never thought I would feel pressured to think. I guess my thoughts don't come that often or just don't continue for twenty minutes straight. I still have ten more minutes to write. I wonder how these will be graded. I have so much to do today. I need to wash clothes, go to the grocery store, I have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend, and I have a test I have to start studying for. I hope the test won't be too difficult. I always worry about the first tests in a class. They pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester. If you do really bad, then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester, if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester. I wish that all teachers would do a review. Reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because I end up going over it again and again. I guess its really repetition that makes me learn. Man, I still have five more minutes to write. I have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class. I was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class. I bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size. There must be so many distractions for the professor because I know I get distracted just sitting there. In an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes, sometimes your focus drifts away. I think that I'm going to like this class. It seems like it will be interesting and fun. I think that if every class was interesting and fun, then the college would be full of 0. 0 students walking down the street. My finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least. \nAsnwer:"
