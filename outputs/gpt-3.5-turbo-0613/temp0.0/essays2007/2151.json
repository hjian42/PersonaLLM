I really like it so far. I had some problems with my course schedule at first but it all seemed to fall into place. My life is like that though everything seems to just work. I don't know if I am the only person that feels like this (I doubt it) but I feel like I will accomplish something big in my life or at least be happy with my life but I don't have a clue what it is that I will be doing. My dad seems to get pissed whenever I tell him that I don't know what I want to do with my life but other adults think that it is a good thing. I think that it is because they don't fund my bill. My dorm room is freezing I am going home this weekend to get some sweats and such. My girlfriend is in town to get her stitches looked at (she had surgery) I hope she is ok. We have been going out for awhile now and I think I love her. I know that I am 00 and don't know what love is but it just feels so right. She is in her last year of college at ORGNAME now so I will only get to see her once a month or so. Everyone says to break-up but it is only one year then she (hopefully) will come to ORGNAME. I don't understand the idea that breaking up is a good plan. I mean maybe if I was one of those people that just love to be in love I would but it isn't that I miss the physical part (though I do) I miss her someone else won't replace that I want her not a body. Now to bore you out of your minds, I am very interested in nutrition/bodybuilding. I played football for 0 years and weighed in at a fat laden 000 lbs. my sophomore year of high school but hey that is ok you play football. well I quit due to many factors and guess what it isn't ok to just be fat. I have worked my butt off literally. I now am 000 lbs and have gained strength. I estimate myself at 00% body fat but I want to do better and I know that I can. I spend a lot of time researching various aspects of training and diets. I think it may be dominating my life. But it isn't a hobby it is a lifestyle. But really who else eats every 0 hours? And for that matter what the heck do they eat on campus I have these cursed dine-in dollars but I can only eat about 0 things here everything is terrible for you! I am not exaggerating ok maybe I can eat 0 things but come on! Why do we not have fat-free cottage cheese? lean beef? real grilled chicken not the baby pieces I am paying for now. Why is it always free pizza at 00 at night complex carb+late night=fat why no free tuna, or free vegetables? why is PROPNAME closed from 0-00:00?! So what if I am not in the friggin weight class I know how to lift better than they do let me in! I worked in a weight room for 0 years you think I can't be courteous and rack my weights or get out of others way let them work-in etc? come on want to fight the freshmen 00? get better food! we were ranked last in dorm food LAST LOCNAME should never be last in anything except for people you wan to fight. this is outrageous. OK Now that I have ranted and let that out I want to know if there is anything I can do about it. NO there isn't how many students would eat fat-free cottage cheese? or tuna straight from the can? not enough to get the food people to bring it in. Oh well survive this year and move off campus next year with my girlfriend and eat right and be happy! something just buzzed in my room. my hands are numb spend the a/c $ on some real food!        \nAsnwer:"
