I REALY LIKE THIS PSYCHOLOGY CLASS. MY PROFESSOR IS PRETTY COOL. HE'S THE ONLY TEACHER WHO MAKES ME LAUGH. ORGNAME IS SO BORING. ITS LIKE BEING IN HIGH SCHOOL. MAN, HIGH SCHOOL IS FINALLY OVER ATLEAST. I'M FINALLY IN THE REAL WORLD. IT FEELS GOOD TO GO TO UT. IT'S LIKE I'M LIVING A DREAM. THIS IS SO COOL. I REALLY NEED TO CONCNTRATE ON MY SCHOOL WORK, THOUGH. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT, THOUGH, WITH WORK AND ALL. I HAVE TO TAKE AN EXTREMELY HARD TEST AT THE OLIVE GARDEN TOMARROW. I HOPE I PASS. I CAN'T WAIT UNTILL I START MAKING SOME GOOD MONEY. SPEAKING OF MONEY, I'M RUNNING LOW. TIME TO SEN WORD TO GOOD OL'E MOM. SHE'S SO GOOD TO ME. I SURE DON'T WANT TO LET HER DOWN. I MISS HER AND MY FATHER, AND ESPECIALLY BOTH OF MY BROTHERS. I HAVE SO MUCH FUN WHEN I'M WITH THEM. I MISS PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH CODY. THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN.  I'LL NEVER FORGET MY HOMECOMING GAME ON MY SENIOR YEAR WHEN I HT THAT GUY. THAT WAS SO AWESOME. I'LL NEVER FORGET WHEN THEY HD TO MEDI-VAC HIM OFF OF THE FIELD. THAT WAS SO COOL. I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW I FEALT WHEN THEY HAD TO STOP THE GAME BECUSE HE LOST COUNTIOSNESS. EVERYBODY IN SCHOOL STARTED CALLING ME K. O. , FOR KNOCK OUT. I WISH I COULD PLAY SOME FOOTBALL FOR ORGNAME T. THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. I'M GOING TO TAKE CRYSTAL TO THE NEXT GAME. I CAN' BELIEVE I'VE BEEN WITH HER FOR SO LONG. I GUESS THAT MEANS I'M DOING GOOD. I'M GOING TO COLLEGE, I HAV A JOB, AND A STEADY RELATIONSHIP. SO FAR SO GOOD. I CAN'T WAIT UNTILL I GET THAT DEGREE AND PUT SOME OF THIS KNOWLEDGE TO USE. MAN, ITS ONLY BEEN 00 MINUTES. I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY MANANA AND IT'S GETTING KIND OF LATE. BUT, HEY, ATLEAST I'M BEING CONSTRUCTIVE. WHEN I WENT TO WORK EARLIER, I GOT TO TAKE SOME FOOD TO A COUPLE OF TABLES. I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS, BUT I DID WELL. ONCE  GET INTO THE SWING OF THINGS, I BET IT WILL GO SMOOTH. IT BETTER. IF IT DOESN'T, I'LL FIND A LESS STRESSFUL JOB. THE MONEY AT THE OLIVE GARDEN BETTER COMPENSATE FOR THE STRESS. MY MANAGER IS PRETTY COOL. SHE'S GOING TO WORK AROUND MY SCHEDULE. I WONDER WHAT THIS THING IS GOING TO TELL ME AT THE END?  I HOPE  MAKE A GOOD GRADE IN PSY. SHOOT, ALL MY CLASSES BETTER COME OUT WITH A GOOD GRADE. I'M AFRAID OF FAILURE. I WANT TO DO REALLY WELL AND SUCCEED. SUCCEED IN LIFE AS WELL. I'VE ALREADY MADE A TON OF FRIENDS, AND I'VE ONLY BEEN TO SCHOOL FOR A WEEK. WHEN THE FIRST SEMESTER IS COMPLETE, I'LL BE USED TO EVERYTHING AD START HAVING SOME FUN. BUT UNTILL THEN, I MUST CONCENTRATE ON EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. \nAsnwer:"
