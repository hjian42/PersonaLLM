I should have made coffee instead of drinking 0 cupsof Earl Gray tea because after two cups I have to pee every 00 to 00 minutes. Is it going to flood again. Looks like it is going to rain more. Ihope the tropical depression doesnt stall causing flooding again. We were sooo close last Nov. Itis about time for a nap. all this reading to do toady. That has to be completed today. My school schedule sucks. My work schedule sucks. Added together = triple sucking. I have NO reading time. I need to settle mom's affairs to that I don't have towork this semester. PROPNAME will help me if the probate isnt over. He is truely manic depressive. His birthday upsetting him so he bought his 00 inch TV and now after the LOCNAME LOCNAME deseaster his new Mercedes. Could it be from his Zoloft that he is taking for his premeture ejaculation condition?  If your mental state is fine and you takean anti depressant for a medical condition (non mental), can that cause a mental condition itself?  Was he trueful with me on the ture purpose for taking Zoloft?  Or, is he a scheemer?  The plane flying over triggered my thought that I can't beleive that it has already been a year since that traumatizing pictures on TV of 0-00. I have to pee already but I can't since this is timed. But I need to really badly, now that I thought of it. Dinner. What shall I make?  Should I save my time and just order Pizza?  I hope that my wallet that was stolen in New orleans arrives Monday. I hope that the receipts that I need to return those books are still in it. I am soo thankful that there are still good, honest people left in this world and that one found my wallet. He said that there was no money in it but what other stuff that was in the bill compartment is still there. I need to send that guy something as a thank you for your trouble to send it back to me. What should I send him?  Money for the acutal cost of sending my wallet to me and maybe a gift certificate, but from where?  I was soooo careful, making sure that my back pocket was buttoned at ALL times, almost like an obsession - constantly checking the button. PROPNAME learned though, don't have your , never mind, strangers shouldn't have to read that thought. I hope nothing is wrong with my niece. I hope that she is not upset that I couldn't chat with her while typing this. Only 0 more minutes left. my laundy is ready to be taken out of the dryer. 0 minutes left to keep typing. I may have to restart the dryer to keep my clothes from wrinkeling. Why did I stop ironing all my clothes all the time. But it feels soooo good to not worry about little stuff like that anymore. I am pleased with the present me; although it is a VERY differnt me. Overall, I am pleased with the present. Getting over Moms death is comming along nicely. Still have my mommy moments though. I guess I always will. Im just glad that the urge to call her every sunday, like I have for years, has stopped. That was VERY irritating every sunday not getting to hear her voice. I miss her. But, thats the consiquence of love. Losing them one day. But man, the number of people that I have lost is astonishing. Damn you PROPNAME!!! so many deaths on your shoulder. \nAsnwer:"
