My name is PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, and I am 00 years old and a second year student ORGNAME the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME. I chose this time to talk because I have something very important on my mind. I met this girl about 0 months ago exactly, to this day at summer school (ACC), and we've been going out for about 0 month and 0/0 now. Within the last 0 weeks, I've been becoming very sad, and I think it may be due to our relationship. She does something that i've never had an exgirlfriend do before, and that is. she likes to \"hangout\" with her exboyfriend. It didn't bother me at first, I guess probably because we were just dating and not serious, but within the last month we became very serious and fell in love with each other. This is the first time i've ever been in love, by the way. I have become very jealous of this guy and sometimes even suspicious. I don't think I have suspicions of my girlfriend cheating on me, but that her exboyfriend will put a move on her, and she will realize she misses him and go back to him. I really don't know what to do. She promises me that they are just friends (you can tell we've talked about this a lot), and she does spend more time with me. Maybe i'm just insecure. I've never had a girlfriend stay loyal to me, and that's probably why I fear the same thing happening again. While i'm writing this paper she is with this guy. Let me tell you a story about what happened 0 days ago. It was a Saturday night, and I just got back to my dorm room from work around 0:00pm. At 0:00 pm, my girlfriend calls, and I ask her \"What's up?\" I was expecting her to have some plans for us, but instead she calls to tell me she's \"checking on me\" and that she's going to her exboyfriend's house to watch Saturday Night Live with him because it's a tradition they have had for awhile. I became upset, as you could imagine, and she could tell on the phone. I told her that my roommate and I were going out, and that I would talk to her some other time then. So, my roommate and I prep to go out. I should probably mention that I have had a habit of doing dip, snuff, tobacco, or whatever the proper term is for it, and i've been attempting to break the habit for my girlfriend since she hates it. Well, I grab the last dip can I had in my room (it was in the trash can half empty), and I put the biggest dip all along my lower lip. I was so pissed off! My roommate and I then start walking out the doors to our cars, and as I walk out the sliding door, there she is! First thing she says to me is. \"You have dip in. \" We were a couple of very angry people that night. She had canceled plans with her exbf to come see me. I was then obligated to cancel with my roommate. We walked into my dorm room, and had a long talk that night. She was very upset at me for dipping, but she is also trying to reassure me that she and her exboyfriend are just friends and nothing more. It's very hard for me to cope with. I don't want to break up with her because I like her so much, and I feel we are very compatible aside from this one issue that I don't see eyetoeye with her on. I'm going to try to go along with this and maybe get to know her exboyfriend a little bit better. Maybe that will help me. Only time will tell. Well, it's been fun, but my time is up now. Thanks. \nAsnwer:"
