That's good because I wont have to worry about it later. I can take care of other things on my list, and I 'll be that much closer to going home. I like my new place. Its big and cold and my best buds live there. Theyre all cool except for the new guy, jon. This fella really has a stick up his ass. I respect that he works full time and is usually tired, but come on. Working doesn't give you any special rights except to get a paychek. It sure doesn't mean that all of your roommates should feel sorry for you and get you things. I can tell this is going to be a problem. We've already had words several times. What blew my mind was that this guy was willing to let it escalate into a fistfight in less than a minute. I mean, he's got to live with me for a whole year!  Am I the only one thinking here?  I really had to get raw then, telling him that that is NOT how we handle things in a civilized society, especially mine. He wants to shack up with me, PROPNAME, and PROPNAME, then he has to realize that we're tight and that if anybody gets roughed up, its him. Also, PROPNAME's girlfriend has become a permanent fixture, already. I don't understand why she can't live where she pays rent, and carry on a relationship simultaneously. Everyone else does. I love bob to death, but this woman is no good for him. They're engaged, and she still gives everybody the \"look\" when he leaves the room. I feel sorry for him. But I should probably be glad it's not still me. I think the only reason that I bitch about some things is that it frustrates to see my bros not have it together like I do. Like half of my boys from dobie last year aren't even coming back. and the clincher, the real salt in the wound, is that none of them couldn't mentally make it here, its that they were so fucking lazy and unmotivated that they pissed it all away. Those were some of my best friends ever. I'll keep in touch with them, but when I talk to them I always feel a twinge of anger at them for not filling thier end of the bargain. They say they'll be back next semester, but I don't believe. A lot of them are so lazy that not even seeing what they'll miss is enough to get their attention. That's why I stay focused and that's why I'll stay at ut. \nAsnwer:"
