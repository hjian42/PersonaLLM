I knew about a book that I was supposed to read in English class last year that was supposedly written in stream of consciousness but since i never read it I have no idea what it was about. Instead I read Crime and punishment. that was probably the most depressing book i have ever read. right now I'm reading a tom clancy novel, which is much more exciting. I can't wait to go back to dallas this weekend to see my family and girlfriend. they are all so excited. plus i get to see my grandma and actually get some real food. Man the food here sucks. sure there's variety, but half the time they don't even have something green out there. I mean how the hell are we not supposed to get that freshmen 00 if they aren't even giving us some friggin green beans. My allergies are killing me. i think i almost died last nite i was coughing so much, and i'm sure i kept my roommate up. but i don't really care. he shafted me. he was going to give me a ride to dallas this weekend but instead, he made his girlfriend come down so now he won't take me. He could have just seen her down there, but he didn't want to have to be around adult supervision for that long. oh well, i'll get him back. hehehe. yeah so my arms are definitely starting to get tired. i definitely haven't done this much typing since fourth grade with PROPNAME PROPNAME. that was the year that I was introduced, and subsequently failed fractions. damn i hate fractions. with mrs. hatch. evil lady. there is so much reading that i have to do for my classes but so far i am really liking them. i took five pages of notes today in my architecture class, but at the end i was ready to take more. we were talking about hitler and the nazi's, but mainly about the architect that hitler hired to build his sets for his speeches, and the headquarters of the nazi party. I'm now listening to pink floyd and i feel as though i'm on a space ship. this is some crazy stuff. i use this cd to put me to sleep every nite. and usually by the second song i'm asleep. it is so cold in this room i'm having to crap, somebody's knocking on the door. ok i'm back;. now where was i. ah yes my toes probably have frost bite now i could get up and turn up the thermostat but then i start sweating profusely and that's definitely no good. it's been very hard for me to meet people in my dorm so far. i'm in the new dorm, san jacinto, and it's like a hotel.  since everyone has their own bathrooms no one really has a chance to mingle, because they're always going somewhere. everyone seems like they're on a mission and they'll kill you if you get in their way. i'm not exactly the most outgoing guy in the world, so let me tell you it's more than intimidating. i had such a close, great group of friends in high school that i could tell anything to. and they felt the exact same way. now, i have no one to talk to except a few of my friends that came here. The problem with that is, i just know too many people here, so there's always someone to hang out with, we just don't get new people to hang out with. and it's also kind of pointless if you sit down and think about it. because the odds are, if you see someone somewhere and introduce yourself to them, you very well may never even see them again. I mean, how much does that suck. ooh this is my favorite part of the song. shine on you crazy diamonds. wow, that just made me think of band banquet from last year and i have absolutely no idea why. unless it's because my date was wearing a gold sequine dress and was definitely shining. yeah, that's prolly it. oh lord my hands are tired. i'm so out of shape. i've definitely lost like 00 pounds of muscle over the summer. and now, everyone here is huge. i was big back in high school, but comparatively, i'm a stinkin shrimp. and i really don't have any particular skill at any sport. i played soccer in high school, but i played goalie and i hate it now. i'm average at any sport but i don't really excel at anything in particular so i'm at a decided disadvantage. \nAsnwer:"
