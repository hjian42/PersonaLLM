Maybe I'm tired because its cold in here. Why a writing this paper?  Am I going to be judged on what kind of person  I am by these rambling thoughts that I type down. I'm still mad that I lost my remote control to my reciever on the move up here. It will probably cost around  00 dollars to get a new one. You know I found it impossible to clear your mind of all thought, because to be able to do this you have to be thinking to remind yourself your not supposed to be thinking. Dad's birthday is this weekend. Probably going to go see him. I wonder how the new restraunt is doing. I wonder how PROPNAME likes running it. I'm getting kind of hungry. To bad there is nothing to eat though. Man I need some money. Maybe I'll get a job working on my days off so that I can have enough money to eat. I still need to read chapter 0 in my psychology book. Its a pretty cool book I like the qoutes by the different people. This computer is under 0. 0 tons I would say. Man I need to get out of the house. All I do everyday go to class come home eat study watch tv go to sleep. And then the next day get up clean the place up eat study watch tv study shower well I guess I shower the day before two and then go to sleep. LOCNAME is very different. I had 00 people in my senior class and everybody was extremly friendly. Here everbody is different. Maybe they weren't raised the same as me to be polite to everybody. That alright. I'm sure I'll find some friends that have the same views as me. Whats the deal with all my classes talking about how depressed you are supposed to get. Its kinda like they are telling you that if you don't become depressed then you arent normal. Maybe I will, just to be like everyone else. Nah. Maybe I should start lifting weights again or swim. Man this is weird. I keep thinking in the back of my head that this is supposed to be stream of concious but for some reason I keep trying to make sense on way I saying. Damn that really scared me the dang air conditioner just made a helluva loud noise. That reminds me of the questionare that I had to fill out for the experimental research for this class. Are you afraid of spiders do you constantly look for spiders do you dream of spiders thats crazy. Hey that reminds me of Saturday Night Live. Thats Crazy. That pretty funny. Mispelled thats. Oh well. One minute left tick tock tick tock  tick tock oh no time has stopped 0:00 AM that is what it says why is it when you notice time it goes by so much slower ding ding 0:00 our time here is done. \nAsnwer:"
