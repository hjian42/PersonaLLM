No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have never had to write like this for a class before, but I believe that I have done something similar to this on paper -- like in a journal or something. I'm not sure what I am going to write about for twenty minutes, but I guess it will not be that hard. there's a really cool song on channel 00 right now -- I heard it while I was doing my hoomework last night. it's like a live version of a song by LOCNAME. I think I'll go out and get the CD. when I have the money -- haha. this is a really cool group. I think I can get into their music. I'm  a real music lover. I think there's always a song of some sort playing in my head. I can't wait to hear a lot of the live music downtown. hopefully we (my roomates and I) will go soon. music and art are really my thing, even though right now my major is biology. I'll probably end up giving in and doing what I want to do. I just don't know how I'll make it (financially). but enough about that. lets see. gosh, PROPNAME PROPNAME is SO gorgeous. I really want to go back out there this weekend. it's so relaxing. I love being up here in austin. see, I'm from corpus christi - which is also a very pretty city - but it's just so FLAT down there. the land and everything. all we have is mesquite trees and cactus. the beach is great, but I grew up in a more rural part of south texas about 00 minutes or so from the beach. I can't imagine moving back to south texas though, not now that I've seen hills and trees. and no humidity!  my hair does great here. my parents should retire around here. might be good for thier alergies. I don't think I will live in austin forever, but as far as texas goes, I think it's the only place I might live. I want to travel though. see all the places I've never seen. maybe I'll study abroad. who knows. gosh, my parents would die. see, I'm the only child. I've already had to come home like 0 times since I moved here in august. I miss them too though. a lot. I guess maybe I'm not supposed to go off on a tangent like that. i'm just suppossed to write about what thoughts come to mind. but I guess those were what came to mind. hmmm. i'm tired. yes, I hope I'm able to get more sleep tonight than I did last night. maybe I'll get motivated and get all my work done before. oh. 0 o'clock?  probably not. but I'll get to sleep in friday and this weekend. I had better get motivated today. yeah, I guess after this I will begin studying and then go out for a jog. I always feel better after I excercise. and excercise is something I really need right now. there's just not enough hours in the day, you know?  I'm taking 00 hours and 0 of the five courses involve a lot of reading. the other two involve a lot of ananlytical thinking -- something I don't enjoy a whole lot. well, not at all, actually. ok, times up. twenty minutes. wow -- that went by more quickly than I thought it would. and check out my HUGE run-on paragraph!  I hate those. oh well. \nAsnwer:"
