At first I was afraid that LOCNAME was going to be a difficult experience for me since I had never been far away from home for more than one week, but it has turned out well. I've met a lot of people. Last night, I had a really good time. Even though I was out really late it was an enjoyable experience. I have tried to maintain friendships with people from my small town of LOCNAME. Although many of them weren't close friends they are still a contact to a world so different from the world that I used to live in. Nonetheless, I don't think I want to live in the past. I want to live life to the fullest. In fact, I decided a few days ago that the only way to adjust and have fun, I have to remember that I am a naturally outgoing person even though shyness sometimes overcomes me. Due to this, I have met more people. I do hope that the people I have met so far aren't psycho, though. You never know who you are talking to in a town this size or what that person must be thinking. Last night I had to ask some random person for a ride because the dorm dorms were locked and there was no one there to answer. Under any normal circumstances I would not have done such an irresponsible and dangerous acts but I was scared and I didn't want to spend the night in the lobby. As a result, I see that UT and Austin are turning me into a new person that I always wanted to be. Uninhibited. Fun. Wild. Although these characteristics have always been in me I realize now that they are barely rearing their heads for a a new beginning of adventure and excitement.  I don't miss home as much as I thought I would. I see that freedom and self-rule has begun to change my personality (hopefully for the better). However, I can't help but think that it may all be wrong. What if home is what kept me safe and secure. Being away from my boyfriend is the hardest. It has been two weeks since I last saw him and already doubts have sprung into my mind. I think of him and don't miss him the way I thought I would. I do in a way but not as badly as expected. A friend told me to keep her posted on my feelings and what I was thinking but I feel that talking about my lack of feelings would be almost as bad as being unfaithful to him. Nontheless, UT is proving to be a different and definitely exciting experience that I hope to enjoy for many more years. The future lies ahead and I await it with an anxiousness I have never known. I hope it all works out in the end. \nAsnwer:"
