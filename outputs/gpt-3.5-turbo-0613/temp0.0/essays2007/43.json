No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I\u2019m tired, stressed and I really don't feel all that good right now. my stomach hurts but I\u2019m tired. I feel pressured. pressure from everywhere. school, work, life. how do I know what I\u2019m doing with my life is what I was meant to do?  I love amy she means the world to me. I wish that I hadn't broke up with her last year. it ruined a lot of things in my life. but I thought that I would be happier with someone else and I was for a short period of time but not a day went by that I didn't think about amy and wonder if she is really the one. I miss my grandpa who died on the first day of school this year. I\u2019ve had a really tough time dealing with his death. I guess I just thought that he would never die. after all grandparents aren't supposed to (I think). I just have a hard time dealing with death. but paw paw is most assuredly in heaven right now looking down on me making sure I\u2019m living my life as a Christian. I will see him again, I know!  the thing is that paw paw really loved amy and she loved him. we were together for almost two years before I broke up with her for selfish reasons which I never found out what they were. I hate to be alone so I started dating janna who is a nice girl but I knew that it was all wrong but I enjoyed the companionship,  which is wrong but was good because it helped me to realize that amy is the one for me. the one that I want to spend the rest of my life with. paw paw knew it. how ironic it was that I broke up with janna only one day before paw paw died and began seeking love from amy. he would have wanted us together. but I messed up and things are hard now,   she still loves me but she is afraid to trust me. I need her!  \nAsnwer:"
