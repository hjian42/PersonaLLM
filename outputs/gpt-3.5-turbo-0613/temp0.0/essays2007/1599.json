No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      I'm sitting here thinking about what in the world my friends behind me are talking about, it's pretty funny. we just got finished eating at taco bell, which at the time sounded like a good idea, but i'm now seriously regretting that choice. My friend is quizzing me about what I am typing and it's really messing me up, she can be so obtrusive sometimes. I can't complain though, because I came here to use her computer so I could print off something, so I should be thankful, right? Oh yeah, I'm using proper grammar, hope that wasn't part of the assignment. I just thought about how long twenty minutes is. This assignment could never end. My friend didn't go to class yesterday, so her and her roommate are talking about this, who knew something so goofy could be talked about for five minutes, but who am I to judge, because I do the same thing. PROPNAME is trying to explain what happened on All My Children to me, not taking into account I am trying to do homework, but the bad thing i actually want to know. I don't feel good, so if this paper is a little weird take into account I am probably delusional from sickness and maybe fever. My nose is running, my throat hurts. Okay now my friend is saying she would have beat me in grade point in high school if she has worked on. she has been saying this for three freaking year, what is the statute of limitations on dwelling?  Oh my God, my nose will not quit running, that makes it very hard to type. You ever realize when you are told to write what you think, the pressure makes it impossible to keep your thoughts on logical things. So instead I just keep thinking how,   I don't know what I'm going to write about  . Now my friends are talking about this show called the rerun show, where they make fun of old shows, this one being saved by the bell. I used to love that show, i can even remember most of the episodes. We are so retarded, I can't believe we are actually talking about this. Remarkably, this conversation has been going on for eight minutes. I actually kept tabs on the little timer thing. PROPNAME has hairy legs, she keeps annoucing it to everyone, who cares. Although, it is kind of gross because she is wearing shorts. Nobody is talking behind me now so once again my thoughts are on the paper and I am drawing a total blank. When this happens I tend to get nervous and my typing gets extremely bad, so I am having to delete alot. Now my friends are watching me and that makes me even more nervous. Oh I bet this makes for an exiting paper for someone to read, the ranting and raving of a sick, saved by the bell loving freak. Something horribly embarrassing happened to me today, I was telling my friend about how my professor says the word LOCNAME weird, guess who was behind me. the professor no less, I am not sure i will ever fully recover from that. \nAsnwer:"
