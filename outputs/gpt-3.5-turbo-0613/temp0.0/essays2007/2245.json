My bio test was incredibly hard and I don't know yet what to think about that chemistry quiz I just took. I've got this spot on the top of my foot that is rubbed raw from my cheap flipflops. I'm really hungry. I wonder if we'll go out to eat tonight or just go to the cafeteria. I only have one class tomorrow, thank goodness. I need a break from school but I find it hard to concentrate on work. there's so much more to do around here. my roommate is never around but I don't mind because my suitemates are awesome. I don't know what to put in this thing. PROPNAME came to visit me for labor day. we're not 'together' but we're still really good friends. maybe sometime we will be but I don't want a serious relationship right now. Esp. not a long distance one. LOCNAME isn't THAT far. But it's still a trek. Esp. since I don't have a car. I have to get a 0. 0 to even consider getting into med school. I hope that bio test didn't just screw me over. everyone's like \"oh it's only your first semester\" but I don't have time to screw up. my family doesn't accept failure. my parents were both brilliant and so is my older brother. I guess if I screw up it'll give the younger 0 kids a little breathing room. give them an opportunity to be 'average' and not feel bad about it. my main problem is procrastination. notice how I'm writing this 'paper' the day before it's due? not to say that I haven't had a lot going on. Because studying for that test was definitely important. 00 minutes is pretty long when you think about it. I can be on the phone for 0 hours straight with no problem, but just typing for 0 is already killing me. I hope psychology is one of my easier classes. I took it because it interests me and I needed some sort of break from my math and science courses. I've been really stressed and I eat junk all of the time. I think I'll go running tonight. but I've worn all of my Sophie shorts around the dorm so they're dirty. And I haven't done laundry yet. I've never done laundry before and it kind of freaks me out. my mom has been a stay-at-home-mom my whole life so she did all of the little things. pack my lunch, make after-school snacks, organize the family's schedule. it was pretty rough trying to organize everything when all 0 of us kids lived at home. But she always managed. as I earlier stated, she's brilliant. my dad works for shell. not like at the gas station or anything but downtown LOCNAME. he does computer stuff. And that's the extent of my knowledge about his job except that he's an IT manager and yeah. veronica is making popcorn and it smells SO good. my blinds are closed so they leave streaks of light across my keyboard and monitor. It's annoying but peaceful at the same time. I have road rage. so I guess it's a good thing I don't drive around here. too many pedestrians and bad drivers. I'd probably get an ulcer or get shot for screaming at the wrong person. I want ice-cream. or pizza. we had ORGNAME yesterday. PROPNAME thinks their food is gross but I love it. PROPNAME and PROPNAME were going to do dancing sometime. I think this weekend?. So that'll be fun. I suck and dancing, but whatever. who really care? there's a quote I like \"those who care aren't important and those who are important don't care\". :) I love that. my other favorite quote is \"a life of love will have some thorns but a life without love will have no roses. \" that's helped me through relationships and crap- my sister PROPNAME taught me that quote. she's cute. Looks just like me! ha just kidding. she's a senior in high school and it would be awesome if she came to LOCNAME next year but she wants to go to a small east-coast college or to a Mormon one in the LOCNAME LOCNAME region. wherever she goes she'll be great. my older brother, PROPNAME, is serving a church mission in LOCNAME but he'll be back at LOCNAME in 0 years. PROPNAME is probably one of the smarter of my brothers. he's in high school and wants to be an architect (sp?). then there's PROPNAME. she made the volleyball team (0th grade) and I'm so proud of her. I tried out when I was her age and didn't make it. Because I sucked. And then I was too embarrassed to try out in 0th grade, which I regret. PROPNAME just started middle school. I'm worried about him because he's such a little, sweet kid. he's completely sarcastic and hilarious, but you have to get to know him or he doesn't talk much. PROPNAME is the baby of the family and my mom said she's just like me. ha-ha poor kid. but she's loud and obnoxious and doesn't take crap from anyone. she's funny and flirty and has all kinds of friends at school. I used to be completely shy so I'm so proud of her for being the outgoing type. she picks up crude phrases from me and the older kids in the house, though, and so that's no good. I like my dorm. some of my friends stay in these crappy small dingy places and I don't understand why they'd pay for that crap. gross. plus community bathrooms freak me out so I love sharing the toilet/shower with just one other person. 0 more minutes on this thing. Gosh. I bit off my nails the other day and so now they hurt. Which doesn't help when I'm typing long papers for psychology. do grammar and punctuation and sentence structure really matter for this assignment? I sure hope not. I figure it's not English class and since I'm fairly good at keeping my grammar understandable, I should be fine. 00 seconds! that is all for now. adieu (sp?) adieu. Whatever. \nAsnwer:"
