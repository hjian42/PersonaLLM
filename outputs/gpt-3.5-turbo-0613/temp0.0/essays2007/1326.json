No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have to go to the SI unit and then the Crew meeting and come home, shower, get ready, and meet PROPNAME and LOCNAME for dinner. I should have some time tonight to do homework. I'm still tired from last night, maybe I can take a nap sometime today. Otherwise, I can always sleep in tomorrow. Having only afternoon classes will be interesting. My lab might be hard because it's at night, but it seems really lax. It's such a difference from the chem labs. I'm so glad it doesn't seem hard at all. I hope my physics lab is easy as well. One can only hope. Not having lab the first week is nice. It worked out well so I could be home to help my parents help move our stuff. It's such a pain to have to move when school is already in session. I'm a little shocked the manager didn't have us sign the lease before we moved in. I hope that's not an indication ORGNAME how much she cares about the renters. At least there's a lady downstairs who has lived here for 00 years that knows everything about this place. It's so nice having an apartment right next to a bus stop. I think it's fate we moved in here. After all the hassles we've had it looks like its going to be worth it. I still have to hang up all my clothes, but everything else is done. I can't forget to meet PROPNAME at 00am on Monday in the ORGNAME to work on physics homework. It's 0 pages long. I hope it's as easy as the first homework. It still took a while to finish though. From 0pm to 0am. This time I'll start earlier. I'm glad that my sister is coming in town, but she picked a bad weekend. I have a lot of reading to do and 0 tests to study for. I need to start seriously studying the PCAT. I can't believe I almost missed the deadline on that again. This is ridiculous. I hope I get into ORGNAME ORGNAME. That's the only place I'd really like to go. Except maybe ORGNAME or ORGNAME of ORGNAME. ORGNAME is probably too expensive. I'd want to live in LOCNAME LOCNAME when I have money so really I only want to got o Pharmacy school in LOCNAME or LOCNAME. The only thing about LOCNAME is I hope PROPNAME has gotten cleaner. I know she never cooks anymore, so probably. We'd have to get a bigger place than what she has now and I might just have to leave all my stuff here and buy new stuff. That's going to be expensive. I hope whatever happens, Mom and Dad aren't disappointed in me. They need a web page for ORGNAME so I know when I need to get in line and for what. The draw system for the football team is so much more efficient, even though they don't give out all the information I need either. Maybe next year I won't buy either. It's so much of a pain. I don't even feel like going. I bet that's how they make their money. I don't know about the plays, but at the games students get crappy seats. I know they were trying to improve that, I wonder if that went through. Probably not. As a whole, LOCNAME just cares about money and not the poor students. That's why alumni get everything. Good luck to the \"sick\" staff. \nAsnwer:"
