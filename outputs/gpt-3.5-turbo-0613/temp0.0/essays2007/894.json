    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: stream of consciousness. we studied about that in junior english. what am I thinking. mowed the lawn. hot sun. sweating. boyfriend says I don't have enough time for him. parents say I spend too much time with him and goofing off . i haven't had time to do anything but work and go to school. i have to work today at 0:00 till close. this is fun I like this assignment. parents are eating lunch. they are always on my back about something or another it seems. they make me so mad . I can't wait to get out of here and get my own place and have my own rules, clean house when I want to and not when they tell me to. i love them but I need freedom. why won't they move my curfew up, why do I even have a curfew. I am 00 years old and I should be able to stay out later than 00:00. i love billy so much. it tears me up that we fight so much. walking on campus. gees yesterday was a bad day. every thing went wrong. i have to host three parties today at work. i wonder what packages they are. billy has my license. I need to get it back today. i wonder where they came up with that name. I wish I could be a famous singer. then I wouldn't have to work so hard at getting money and a decent job. I hate rita. what gives her the right to say that we have sucky cashiers. like she is any better herself. she can't keep employees and not many people like her. she is so rude. i wonder if it is true about her husband. that is sad that her stepson thinks she is his real mom. I can't believe they haven't told him yet . he is what almost about 00 or so. 0mins left. i wonder what our next poject in here is. it says on the syllabus. when I am done I will look. i hope it is fun and not borring and hard to understand like my mythology teacher and english assignments. time is almost up then I will call billy back and take a shower and go to work.    \nAsnwer:"
