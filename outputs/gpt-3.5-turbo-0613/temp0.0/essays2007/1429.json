No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: As I sit in my dorm room at this point in my life, I can think of one thing only, sadness. Sadness because I miss my family and my boyfriend and because I feel extremely lonely at this huge school. I am overwhelmed with my thoughts and concerns. I am scared about meeting new people, scared about making good grades, and in general I'm scared about starting all over again. I know that I should be so excited that I get this opportunity to begin my life again and start new adventures, but I'm not. Last summer, for the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged and I was extremely happy. Of course as soon as I obtained that wonderful feeling, it is ripped away from me at an instant. I feel like I am so stressed out here because I have so much to do at all hours of the day. I'm a very high strung person and need to relax a lot and I'm not really given that opportunity here. Joining a sorority was something I thought I had to do when I got here. So I did and I'm not sure it was the right decision for me. I think snobbery overwhelms my sorority and that bothers me a great deal. I really don't know exactly what my problem is but I just don't feel comfortable here. I am in love for the first time and the guy I love is in LOCNAME LOCNAME. We are not dating because we both agree it would be too hard but I love him so much that words could not possibly describe. It hurts to be in love and know that I will probably never be with him because of our location. I want to transfer but I I would be terrified to do that just for a guy. But when I think about it, I would do that for him. My thoughts are in a jumble right now and I feel many emotions running through my body. I'm not quite sure what I am going to do at this point in my life. My confusion, anger, and stress take over my life and it will take some time to figure out who I am and what I want with my life. \nAsnwer:"
