However, I just wish I would have girlfriend. I keep thinking I want one, but I'm not really sure if it would be really good for me. Looking around right now, I see my stuffed animal duck, my computer with its blue neon lights, my 0. 0 speaker system, and my printer. I really love my sound system. The two sony speakers provide a great midrange, the 0 small logitech speakers give good highs, and my subwoofers provide all the bass I need. My headphones are really nice too. I can?t believe I got them on sale for $00. what a deal. I played Warcraft 0 tonight for seven hours. I look back and don't believe that I actually played that long, but I did. After playing my first three hours, I decided to take a break. But that game is too addicting. I just finished and now its 0:00 am and I have nothing to do. so I figure I might as well write my psychology stream of consciousness paper. My roommate is fast asleep. He really needs his sleep. He gets a good 0 hours a night while I only get my 0 or 0. However, I take a bunch of naps to make up for it. He is a really great roommate. I intend on rooming all four years with him. He respects my space yet jokes around with me when its time to have fun. He keeps our room tidy and clean so we won't be living in a pig pen. My cell phone is really nice. I can't believe I got it for free. ORGNAME sucks though sometimes. I never get reception in my dorm room or in any of the buildings. So if people call, I never get any notice, which can be frustrating. I really miss my best friend kenny. He is in st. louis right now. He just got grounded for staying out all weekend without coming home. Now I can't talk to him or even get in contact with him. I really miss him. I wish that he and his aunt wouldn't have been fighting. If that were the case, he would still be in houston right now. This paper is really interesting because its putting down everything I'm thinking. I'm thinking whatever and its just coming out. my mind is not really in a solid thinking mood. probably because it is 0:00 am. My mind feels jumpy right now. I am still looking at my computer monitor and the duck that sits on top. I'm really glad we lofted our beds in our dorm. It gives us so much more space. Under the bed is our desk which has my computer. On the adjacent wall, our tv sits between the two dressers. I really miss home. Its nathans birthday today, and I won't be home to wish him a happy birthday. That just reminds me that I have to call him tomorrow or else he may get upset. I?m getting my postit notes out right now but I can't find a pen. where is it? oh. there it is. PROPNAME is fast asleep. How can he sleep so early?  well. I guess its not THAT early. Looking at my walls, I have 0 dave matthews posters, an art poster and a ?better luck tomorrow? movie poster. On one wall are all my pictures from my senior year. I really miss my old friends that aren't going to UT. Austin is fun though. I have made so many new friends through basketball, classes, and just walking around. I find it really hard to remember names though. I feel bad sometimes because I have to ask the person 0 or 0 times what their names are. I miss anh back at PROPNAME. I like her a lot. she is just one of those people that are easy going and relaxed about everything. I wonder how this year I have gotten so lazy. I'm too lazy to study for my classes and I can barely make myself do the homework assignments. I use to be so studious. I guess that was before I had a good computer and a basketball gym. plus. I had my parents around back in houston bugging me to do things. I'm really glad I'm not working though. I can now concentrate purely on school. However, I need to start getting back into the swing of things so I won't fail my first semester. my classes aren't difficult, so I better get a 0. 0. Ok. I have two minutes left. My mind is starting to shut down. I am getting tired. I'm not sure if I can stand the 0. 0 minutes left. This is pretty hard towards the end when you are tired and can't think of anything. My mind feels like jello. Looking out my window, I see the tower. I'm so lucky to get LOCNAME LOCNAME 0th floor. My room view is absolutely amazing at night. I think it is weird how my mind works. \nAsnwer:"
