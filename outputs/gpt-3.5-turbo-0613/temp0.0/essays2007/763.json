No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: greetings and salutations all this was written in lower case to emphasize that I have a unique voice  that is inconsequential as compared to the throngs of voices in the world  there is no punctuation to show the natural tendency of people to take pauses for breath rather than for time      I have no idea what to write about    in fact whenever I need to write something that seems simple to others, I somehow make it seem quite impossible to me   this sucks   I want to go play some pool   I wish my friends from LOCNAME were here   then we could go out to play a game or two or three   hey watch out man you are no break dancer though you may actually break something   I'm hungry   I wish I had some of those Ramen Noodles  very tasty indeed   oh wait   I have some ice cream sandwiches   food is food   here I go again babbling about nonsensical stuff maybe I should go walk around in the halls of PROPNAME   very nice ceiling   I like the abstract jackson polluckyness of it  makes me remember the skys of india durning monsoon season  damn what a fine woman  I wonder if she lives on the second floor   do I need to see anyone up there  oh yeah I do  good opportunity to walk with her  without her knowing it   hey its nathan  \"Hey Nathan\"  I wonder if he needs any help  \"Want some help?\"  \"No\"  very determined man. I thiunk I should return to my little quest   I wonder if shannon is in her room  oooooh the door is slightly open   lets just go in   maybe I should have knocked. nah  no need   they trust me   man I want to go out with her  I wonder if she has a boyfriend  \"shannon,  you have a boyfriend?\"  I hope her answer is what I want it to be   it would really suck if she did have one   I guess I would have to find another girl   but that is an impossible task  I want to go out with her   I want to help her blow her air sofa   I want to kiss her for what seems an eternity   I want to do math problems with her    I wonder how exactly I could prove the triangle inequality   maybe with algebra but what about geometrically  would not the vectors cancel each other out   thats it I have to do it algebraically   what about jeffs problem   I don't quite remember  how to integrate using substitution   oh yeah  I must find u and dv or was it the other way around   \"No\"  oh what huh?   did I hear correctly am I in some kind of altered reality   nope I heard correctly  she does not   I am so damn lucky  I really hate the feeling when one cares for a person but the person does not care in the same way   I'll find out from here room mate tomorrow about my chances  maybe it will work  who knows it may be magic. naaah   I doubt that  I won't have any time for her  I will be like one of those Quake III dicks around my dorm who rather play a computer games than go out with people but instead of Quake III it will be math or computer science  speaking of which I still have homework in those classes  but thats do friday  I'll do it thursday  the psych however is do tomorrow what the hell am I going to write   let me go back to my computer   ahhh I have a soft cushiony chair  there is no air flow in here I better open the door. wow what a fox   \"hey shannon\"  \"hey\"  hmmm hmm good  its steve I wonder what he wants. yeha I think will help in the pranck but first I have to do this assignment  I'm hungry  what can I eat  oh yeah  I have ice cream sandwiches. farewell and salud  that is all I have to say of my mind a consequencence of being located in a pubescent testerone laid man \nAsnwer:"
