No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I\u2019m sitting here drinking a beer. what is that picture on my desk-I stole this calculator from a party and I don\u2019t know why-I feel so bored- I've been doing homework all day and it's labor day-what a waste there are tons of people by the pool and I want to go there-its scary though what am I going to eat for dinner-I think that I\u2019m getting fat-I drink too much and am not exercising enough my girlfriend doesn\u2019t want me to order playboy-what\u2019s up with that- she also wont let me smoke my life is controlled-I don\u2019t think that I want to be an engineer anymore-they make lots of money but it might be boring I worked all summer and then had to spend all my money paying my lawyer- I hate lawyers they're scum-I hate fratboys too-although I wish I was in a frat I don\u2019t know anyone at this school-I want to transfer to atm because I know lotsa of people there I have a scholarship here though that I cant just leave. my shoulder is hurting-its from leaning over this keyboard-this has got to be the easiest writing assignment of my life I normally hate writing assignments-I definitely am not going to do that research paper why does this page have no ending width-these sentences are getting really long when am I going to finish my other hw? I missed the first two days of one of my classes and now I don\u2019t even know what the hw assign are. the gate outside my window keeps opening and makes this squeaking noise my roommate is worthless-he\u2019s supposed to get our dishwashing rack and get the exterminator to come but he's too lazy and all that he does is sit around and play his computer game I just looked at the clock and its only been 00 minutes-00 minutes is a long time when you are thinking about it-I remember when I played soccer 00 minutes seemed like 0 hours especially when you were losing I wonder what my family is doing right now-I miss my brother-he\u2019s going to come to school here next year-I cant decide if we should live together or what-it would be a lot of fun I don\u2019t know if I could handle another year in the dorms-they suck especially the bathrooms and the food-actually everything about them is bad- I wonder if anyone is going to be able to read my typing I don\u2019t type like I\u2019m supposed to. I only use about half of my fingers and I don\u2019t use any particular order most of my words look misspelled because I hit the wrong key first aha-00 minutes-only five more to go I wonder if everyone counts down the minutes in their papers-I bet that about 00 percent of the students write a line about how much time has passes ,etc my neck is really starting to hurt now-I worked on the computer all summer-0 hours a day but my neck still isn\u2019t used to it I wonder how many words I've typed so far my brain seems to be at a standstill-should I get drunk tonight? do labs start tomorrow I hope not I love punching the enter key   it feels like I've accomplished something every time it gets punched my friends ought to be here pretty soon of course they\u2019ll want to get drunk its so quiet in here-I\u2019m glad I have a computer and didn\u2019t have to go all the way to the ugl have I almost filled up the entire page-it looks like I\u2019m almost at the bottom I am almost there-I guess that\u2019s why you made the width unending time up    \nAsnwer:"
