I guess I'll find out how random my thinking is, as if I didn't already know. I really like this CD too bad this is his only one. I wonder what CD I should listen to next. I should try to call PROPNAME again. I really want her to come visit me up her. I know how much she likes LOCNAME. I'm really glad that I didn't buy those tickets for the ORGNAME ORGNAME since now I have a math test that night. I wonder when the concert starts. I really do want to go. And the concert is the day after my birthday, it would be a present to myself. Plus, I've been waiting 0 years for them to play in LOCNAME. I really like this song. This room is rather boring. We definitely need to get some more stuff on the walls. I have to make a list of stuff to pick up when I go home, otherwise I will forget everything and I don't know when I'll be going home again. I think I'll listen to ORGNAME next. I haven't listened to that CD in awhile. I'm glad I decided to bring the CD with me. Today is PROPNAME's birthday, and PROPNAME's. I should send PROPNAME a card. I wonder if PROPNAME got the one I sent her. I need to get a prepaid calling card so I can talk to her. She needs to come visit me too. I should probably email her again. This bed is so hard, it's making my back hurt. But I have to admit, it's not quite as hard as the one I had during orientation. You would think the mattress would give some after having so many people sleeping on it. I miss my bed at home. It's so comfy. Wow there are a lot of people walking by all of a sudden. I think that this is one of the coolest assignments I've gotten in a long time, it's much better than all the busy work I had to do last year. My mom will be happy to know that I like my psychology class. I won't be talking about music all the time, I'll actually have something related to my major to tell her. Well I think that's been my 00 minutes of truly intelligent thinking. \nAsnwer:"
