No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I'm also, I just got interrupted by a friend of mine I always seem to run into someone when I'm in the computer lab she's in my Spanish class which is nice because she always makes me laugh I wish I could type I can't so this assignment is going very slowly for me anyway back to my friend she and I used to live together my freshmen year then over the summer we both went to the same language school in LOCNAME only I didn't know she was going to be there and vice versa we saw each other in the court yard of the school one day by chance it was pretty weird to go all the way to another country just to run into your housemate I'm pretty tired and these 00 minutes aren't going by very fast I need to get home so I can watch road rules but I don't know where to catch my bus which is a little comical considering that my 00 years old I should know how to use public transportation I don't though because I usually drive but the parking situation is so bad I would have to wake up at the crack of dawn to find a parking place even then it would probably take an act of God oh well I don't have to worry about that today I only need worry about finding my bus I think it's in front of jester I have a lot of classes in jester this semester which I don't like I hate that place it reminders me of my freshmen year not that I lived there it's just that it's such a freshmen place and it smells bad like a day care center ok I would like to apologize for that low blow I was a freshmen too once speaking of freshmen why given the parking problem are they allowed to have cars on campus that pisses me off \nAsnwer:"
