Did I catch something from PROPNAME because he was sick last week but maybe it was from sleeping with the fan on high. Oh well I'm feeling better today than I was before. Wow it hasn't even been two minutes yet. How am I going to keep thins up for twenty?  Oh well at least it doesn't really matter what I type. I wish I knew how to type faster. I have to slow my brain down to get my fingers to keep up. Stupid geometry book. I hope that I did my homework proofs right. Thanks so much Mr. PROPNAME for not making me do proofs in high school geometry. I'm really not an orange juice fan, but I have to drink it so that I can tell PROPNAME that I did so he won't worry about me not getting enough vitamin C with my cold. Ooh I need to plug my cell phone in I think it's about to die. I'm really glad I called Mama today on the bus ride home. I miss her. I wonder what I should get her for her birthday. It seems like it was her birthday just yesterday. This year went by super fast. Six minutes down fourteen to go. I'm starting to get hungry. What do I want for dinner tonight?  I kind of want to order some chicken wings but I shouldn't they're to fattening and we have tons of food here. I should make something. maybe I'll just heat up some chicken and dumplings. That would feel good on my throat. That tomato soup I had the other day was really good too, even if it was hill country fair or whatever that crazy generic ORGNAME brand is. I miss PROPNAME's and good old Hi Top brand. Nobody here has even heard of LOCNAME's. I guess it's because their all from LOCNAME. Fuck LOCNAME. LOCNAME is not LOCNAME. People who say they've been to LOCNAME but have only been to LOCNAME haven't been to LOCNAME. Any way doo doo doo dooty doo. I'm seriously running out of thoughts to type. cough cough I need to go to PROPNAME's to get my Roubatusin. I'm fairly certain that's not how you spell that but oh well I never claimed to know how to spell anything. Today I saw this girl over near the MLK statue with food in her hands holding it out to the birds and she let pigeons and grackles land on her hand and eat out of it. Not only let them but wanted them to. I had to laugh because I realized that girl must not know shit about shit\" to quote the Daily Show. Only five more minutes woo hoo. Let's see when I'm done here I should work on my Spanish homework but I think instead I'll fill in my new uncalandar. I was so excited when I found it at the co-op today. I had one last year and I loved it. Then I went back this year and I couldn't find them. When I saw them today I bought two in case they didn't have them again when I go to buy school supplies next August. Okay two and a half more minutes. I wonder if I should stop in mid sentence when tim is up or finish my thought. Did it say that in the instructions and I wasn't paying attention?  Oh well I'll cross that bridge when I get there. I can't believe I forgot to print the confirmation page for my pretesting  I hope I get that credit  That was one of the most boring experiences of my life I would hate to think it was all for nothing. Or naught as PROPNAME would say. \nAsnwer:"
