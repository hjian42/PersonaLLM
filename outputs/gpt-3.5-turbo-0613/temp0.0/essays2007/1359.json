Although, this music is good blues unlike the top 00 crap that normally comes blaring out of their speakers. My roommate is on the phone with a friend complaining about his classes, assignments, his teachers, and the other usual complaint. In the back of my mind I am a bit nervous about the paper I have to write for my Rhetoric 000 class. procrastination was a big problem of mine throughout high school. For a change, I wrote a page of the paper last night. However, I am not sure of the quality but nevertheless it is only a first draft and I just need to turn it in on time. Bing! Bang BooM! I hope I see this girl named PROPNAME at the LOCNAME LOCNAME mixer tonight. I can't believe she lived in my hometown of LOCNAME LOCNAME for two years. It's A small world after all. It's a small, small world. Bought printer paper today. Need to call my brother. Need to email my English teacher. So many things so little time. Oh well, keep on keeping on. I wonder why my brother PROPNAME has not emailed me back. I wonder where he is? Did he leave LOCNAME? Who Knows? blankness washing over me. Who, who, who let, who let who who who let them dawgs out? Whistling in the hall. Shut Up! You are annoying me and taking over my stream of consciousness, but I guess it doesn't really matter what goes through the stream because the whole idea is just to type what is going through the mind. What is going through the mind? Tired? No, not particularly. Back is getting a little stiff though. Count backwards from 000 by seven and see if stress level goes up. Sickness. I was sick last week. coughing coughing coughing. runny nose, headache, ears hurt, throat hurt. Aaaagghh! PROPNAME. I miss my baby girl. She is a one year old poodle who I spent my entire summer with because of my broken leg. I miss her. I think she misses me. I hope she misses me. She has been sleeping on my bed. I hope she doesn't think I have abandoned her. Whistling. Boy, these guys are loud. Two days after a workout is when you are at your peak soreness. Full hour late for class. Oh boy, I am repeating the words of the guy that just walked into my room. Daily Texan. Something about the Daily Texan. Forever and ever amen. blankness Blank Man starring PROPNAME PROPNAME was a really bad movie. Pure Crap! Soreness. I feel soreness too. My neck. Huge! Wow! Neat! OK Ok My printer is working pretty well. Printed off a bunch of stuff for biology. Three minutes left. Copies. Copies. Who let the dawgs out? This tune has become the anthem of the hall. One side actually likes the piece of rubbish. The other side plays it as a joke. Forever and ever amen. PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME \nAsnwer:"
