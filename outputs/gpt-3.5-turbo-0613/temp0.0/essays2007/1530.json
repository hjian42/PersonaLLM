It is a very odd mixture but it was really good. I can still smell the barbecue sause and taste the sause on the corners of my mouth. I can't believe how much things I want to accomplish this semester and everything seems to go slow. It is difficult making friends because I'm not used to ssing so many students in one class, and everything time i have a ifferent group of people I sit with. I feel lonely and a little bit frustrated sense I am not really sure what would make me feel alittle better. It is Friday and it seems like it is the weekend, it is a bit odd because i am not in school or in class. A few minutes ago I came back from PROPNAME and PROPNAME, and I attempted to study Biology, Chemistry and alittle bit for this class but I only managed to study for Biology. Mitosis, what an interesting process. It is still boring because I know all this material from high school. I get so bored of learning the old material over and over again. However, this chapter did continue on with the enzymes and other chemical components it needed. I am so tired right now. I had a very nice sleep, maybe a little over eight hours but I am so tired. I kind of dozed off at BN, and I stopped reading. Instead I picked up a PROPNAME PROPNAME book I haven't been able to read and started to read it. I think I wasted more time reading that book than reading one chapter in biology. I got into that book quite quickly and I wasn't able to put it down. I started to have a headache and I got hungry. i don't have a headache anymore. Gee. it's only seven minutes and i have about thirteen minutes left. How come everytime i stop counting or timing i end at the number thirteen? thirteen hours of classes, thirteen minutes left, thirteen this and thirteen that. My goodness, I must have tons of bad luck. Or. is this my lucky number? haha, that would be very interesting. I feel quite happy right now I am still remember the events that occured last night. I can still here the the drums vibrating off the speakers and the guitars and the singers that I can barely hear. Frequency. It was pretty nice for the first one I went to. It was so humid and I felt so sticky. Gross. I dont' know what I am thinking right now. My train of thought seems to be discombobulated. I always go to one subject to the next. It seems that everyone does that, but it is weird. Even when I talk to many people, I digress off the subject. I can not believe I am typing for twenty minutes. I've done this before, but I had to hand write it out. The good thing about hand writing is that it takes a longer time and you don't have to constantly think or what you are thinking next. My eyes are feeling alittle droopy now. Should I close my eyes and type? haha. . okay I will do that. i might start falling asleep if i do this. Maybe I should open my eyes again. Okay, well, I wonder if grammar and punctuation and capitalization really matters in this writing assignment. What a coincidence. . it's been THIRTEEN minutes again. Why do I do this to myself. My hands are feeling a little numb from typing this, but my palms haven't become sweating, but my fingers feel weird. Maybe it is because of the rubber band aroiund my wrist, is must be cutting off circulation. I am thinking right now that I won't be able to quit. I just heard my brother's alarm on his watch. My brother is still in highschool, I wonder how much torture he's going through. I hated LOCNAME history in highschool, and now my brother is taking it. It's not that I hated the content, I didn't like the teacher. She was so evil. The clock rang that it is three-o'clock. My AIM had shut the door telling me that someone went offline. Wow, I am still going on. three more minutes left. My neck is hurtingn and I want to quit. I think this assignment is so long. I want to take a break, but I dont' think I will be able to. i think i am typing faster than i was in the beginning. I want this writing assignment to be over now. NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW! I am just babbling out. I am looking at the xperiment record sheet for psychology. Wow, five hours? YES one more minute left to do this. should I count down? I want this to be over now. I wish it was over not. why almost thirty more seconds. I am so impatient now. very impatient. VERY VERY impatient. Almost done ten more five seconds. look like it is over. \nAsnwer:"
