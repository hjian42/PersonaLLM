No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Don't get me wrong UT is great but there's still something missing: my girl, PROPNAME. Sometimes life just don't make sense. One minute you're the king the next you're down in the gutter. Man I wish I was still with my girl, or shall I say ex. Things are messed up. All cause of family nagging and distance, the whole thing fell through. The hell with this ?oh college is awesome, so many chicks? crap. I had a girl who was good looking, not a ho, who was caring, who was intelligent, and loved me. Thanks to all these circumstances though outside my control, the break up took place, or rather the ?time off? as she put it. What's 000 miles got to do with it? Too bad she is a year younger or that I'm a year older. Things aren't fair in life. Speaking of bad things, my step father has been having problems with his kidneys recently. He started dialysis today back home in LOCNAME LOCNAME. Funny how me and him used to be at each other's throat but over the last two to three years we bonded and got pretty close. I miss the bastard. It was weird seeing him cry the day that I left. Here was this macho tough guy crying over his step son leaving for college. My mom didn't fair much better either. She had the water works going. That was the toughest part of leaving town. I won't miss ORGNAME ORGNAME much. Just some of the people I left behind, PROPNAME included. Things change, I went down to watch a ORGNAME LOCNAME football game last week. It was against our border rivals PROPNAME PROPNAME. Trust me these two towns hate each other. They did a lot of talking but we still won the game by 00. Damn I say we like if I played or something. Anyways we beat them down last year by 00 in their place too. Good old? PROPNAME PROPNAME, always an easy win. Austin is cool, but man there seems to me there's not many folks like me. All the white people seem to be afraid of me or something. Look in class sometime. I sit way in the back in seat 0 front row and there's always seats next to me open. If someone actually sits down its cause there's no where else to sit. I don't bite and I do shower. I guess people tend to hang with their kind. My kind doesn't exist here. The Hispanics here don't accept their heritage, most anyways. They either want to be white or black. I can't go up to them and say something like ?Que Onda? cause they DON'T know Spanish. Its messed up. My Spanish is decent but I look like a god compared to some of the Hispanics here. Oh well I'm glad that at least my roommate is my friend from my home town. At least we can still ?cag? it together. It's a Tex-Mex term from LOCNAME Pass, basically meaning to joke around and act stupid. I'll tell you more about the origin another day. Oh yeah ORGNAME suck. Come on pull it together men! Win one for the gipper, do something. The team played horribly in the second half. Hope they do better next week on Monday Night Football. Man this is crazy. My foot itches, damn athlete's foot. Should get something for it. Typing late at night is fun. I need to go download the new Obie Trice Album, too bad its only on PROPNAME right now and I can't get it yet. In due time I suppose. I still have yet to find out how truly hard college life is so far. My roommate has a test today and he spent the whole day yesterday studying like a mad man. I'm glad I'm not taking any science course this semester. Life is good though. Small problems aside I don't have much to complain about other than Calculus, but I'll be fine with it. \nAsnwer:"
