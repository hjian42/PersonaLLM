No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am the egg man whoo I am the egg man whoo i am the walrus coo coo cachoopp? and that girl with the intriguing eyes looked through my spectacles and I could sense her ability to discern my anxiety. she knew she was pretty, and my sudden glance away from her, told her exactly what I was thinking. just from one moment, a bug's seconds glance, I was ashamed. as if I had stumbled upon a lady, naked or something horrible that would define my clumsiness of timing. but its all the same if you don't mind dear reader. I'm just a bit antsy, anxious, looking for colors undiscovered of nature yet. I am positive God has a predestined pastel palette that he has not yet utilized. I mean who knows? with all the toxins in the air, it makes one wonder who is the greater painter of a sky or landscape, man or God? so my friend and I are walking in a park and I said, \"wow what pink skies, I am so amazed at the beauty that surrounds me at this moment, I mean its all celestial, you know all of it \"\"hey, want me to burst your bubble,?\" she says. \"I know I'm going to regret this, but yeah tell me why!,\" I said. \"its because of pollution. the gases in the air. \" and then everything drowned in the void of her gibberish, hogwash, drivel, and my subconscious began to speak for her almost. I wanted to believe that it was something supernatural. something that was not polluted or tainted by the industry of man's ambition and stuff. \"no\" I said. \"that's not true,\" I rebutted. \"because if you look at the painters of 00th century romanticism, you notice the Delacroix pinks and blues of paint in the skies. or ORGNAME's exaggerated oranges and stuff \"she didn't know what I meant, and I don't think I was talking much sense either. but those faded or bleached greens never leave do they? the trees, like that of an oil painting. its all too much it seems for some, I guess even me. they, those greens, speak of nature's affinity with the species it serves, and the congruence of it all. I think that if she, my friend, would have told PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME that same monstrous factoid she had told me, I could probably imagine him in a self portrait without any ears at all. coo coo cachoop? that damn Beatles tune. \nAsnwer:"
