No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: The computer that I am on is not very good, so oi hope that it doesn't kick me off, because it would really suck to have to do this all over again. I don't reallly understand how writing my miscellaneous thoughts will help me to learn about psychology. I do see how it can help others study my psychology, but what do my thoughts have to do with a class on introdutory psychology. This last few days I have really missed my girlfriend, seeing as how she is still at home, finishing her senior year. But thankfully I get to go home in 0 days and will hopefully get to see her for an entire saturday. I love her more and more every day which leads me to the conclusion that absence does make the heart grow fonder! I got a job as a houskeeper in the union on the weekends from three to midnight. The sorry thing is that I won't get to see any football games and also my dad is coming to visit me this weeekend, and won't get to see me untill monday because of my job. the good thing about my job is that I really won't have a chance to party. I have been sober for a year now and would lie to keep it that way, and my job will hopefully keep me away fromthe parties. I have given up drugs, cigarettes, and alchohol which leaves me with only reforming my dirty mouth. The way in which I plan to do this is by wearing a rubber band around my wrist and popping myself everytime I cuss. I also let the people around me know about this so that they can inform me of the times that I cass without my knowing it. College life has been pretty good to me so far, but my cousin is not responding nearly as well as I am. I have heard that she calls hrying everynight to her house. But I think that it is because of the fact that her parents, particularly her mother have done everything for her and always spoken for her the entirety of her life. Now that she is own her own, she doesn's know what to do with herself. I feel sorry for her sometimes, bt other times I think that it is about time she learned what life outside her family is like. I do hope that things get bette for her. and that things stay good for me \nAsnwer:"
