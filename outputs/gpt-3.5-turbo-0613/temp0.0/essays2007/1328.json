And I'm sad. OH! And I was supposed to go to this concert in two days but both of my at home fiends canceled on me. One I don't' really like so it doesn't bother me but PROPNAME has a sorority thing. That one kind of upsets me. See, we planned this concert back when we all realized that we were going to different colleges. We decided to plan something so that we wouldn't for forget each other, but I guess it's happening sooner than we thought. We've all been together for a very long time. 0 years I think. I don't care. I guess it's not that big of a deal. I don't really like being at college. I mean. it's fun. And there aren't any rules, but. I really miss everything about my home. And I don't mean like, home as in my house. I've gone back there and it's totally different. It doesn't seem like I belong there. And I guess I don't. That's what this is all about. I don't like this assignment. It's making be sadder than I was to begin with. Is that the point? I really like my psych class. My calculus class on the other hand. sucks! A whole bunch. Not only is it at 0 [which is an hour that I don't do], but the guy I seriously think is making things up! I can type pretty fast. I wonder if this is going to fit in the little box. I don't type that fast, but I mean. it looked like a pretty small box. I bet it can be as big as you need it to be. that would make sense. Yeah. So anyways. I wonder how long it's been. Oh dang it! I forgot to look what time I started. I wonder if I'm allowed to talk to other people while I'm doing this. Ok. I did. You'll never find out. Oops. I am telling you. Hehe. Yeah that's funny. My roommate said that she thinks that I've been doing this for a while. I think that that means 00 minutes. I'm going to stop now. Ok. I'm not sure what to write about. I guess. I'm cold. I'm hungry.
