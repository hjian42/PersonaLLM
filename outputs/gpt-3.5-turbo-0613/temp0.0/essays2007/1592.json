No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:    Well for some reason I am stressing out about everything that is going on in the first few weeks of school! Not only are classes overwhelming and so much different than high school because of number of students in each class, but I am in a whole new city! For the first time I am away from my family trying to make my own choices, doing my own laundry, making my own food, and trying to make new friends. I am scared about being able to study too! And I am scared about failing. I also just went through PROPNAME and I am in a sorority which is also very overwhelming. We just had a meeting and we have to keep a certain ORGNAME, finish many hours of volunteer work and stay at the house for at least 00 hours a week to study there. We also have mixers twice a week at night. I don't know how I ma going to manage all of these things at once. I am also stressing about finding where to live next year. I had a deposit down for an apartment with a girl I met during the summer, but the more I got to know her, the more I knew I couldnt live with her. So now I am trying to find a group of nice girls and find a place to live before they are all taken. Not to mention my ex boyfriend is here and things between us are very complicated. I wish he could communicate with me and tell me how he really feels because I am tired of playing all these stupid games! We keep trying to make each other jealous, but I really care about him alot. OHHH and I am getting sooooooo fat! I swear our older sorority sisters want to keep giving us cookies, cake, and candy to make us fatter! I don't have time to excercise. But I really love it here and I know I am going to have so much fun! I have already met several awesome girls that are so fun to hang out with. And since I came from a small baptist schoool its interesting to meet so many different kinds of people. I love how ORGNAME is so diverse. I love my roommate too. I went pot luck and was kind of nervous about that but we are perfectly matched. We are both neat freaks and have the same personality. I hope we become great friends, so far we have talked about everything. She is really smart too. I miss my best friends from high school. Two of them went to ORGNAME, I was baout to go there with them but I loved UT. It was a hard choice to make though. The only person I really knew here were a few older girls that went to my high school and my ex boyfriend. . who is frustrating me! I couldnt sleep at all last night because I was upset with him! I miss my mom and my family too. Even my dog. I don't know when I will go home. . it seems like there is so much to do here. OHH I really want to see the movie Swim fan and Sweet Home LOCNAME. I bet I won't have time to see movies here and I don't have the money either! My money is all gone! I have no clue where it went, I never get to go shopping here. I also need to find a church to go to, just to keep me grounded. Its kind of hard to focus here. But I am really happy about the sorority I am in. It was such an emotionally draining process, so many girls where heartbroken. But I just hope that there isnt a stereotype against sororities because each girl I have met has been truly kind and helpful and its such a great way to meet people and do stuff for the community too. I am going to the childrens hospital tommorrow morning to visit the children there. I am really excited about that. I love kids. I think I want to be a teacher, I just hope I have the patience for it and that I make it through college! Its so weird to think I am in college right now trying to get a degree! I still feel like a little kid sometimes. Hopefully I will be able to focus and get settled down and figue out my priorities! \nAsnwer:"
