No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Right now I am in my apartment with my two room mates and one of their girlalking to the friend and her friend. My roommate is wistling some weird tune while watching seinfeld and talking to the girls. My computer is writing unbelievably slow because of all these unbelievably uneccessary pop-ups. Speaking of unbelievable, how do you spell it?  Is it with an ie of ei whatever I guess it really doesn't matter. I just answered the door and signed for some package for my roommate. The delivery guy was chill, I like UPS. My roommate just put on a PROPNAME PROPNAME dvd so at least I'm listening to some pretty sweet music. I am currently eating a cliff bar flavored chocalate brownie. It looks like predigested food, but at leats it taste fairly good. I just looked to my right and noticed my bike which I have not ridden since I got to LOCNAME. Its a ORGNAME ORGNAME, which is a pretty sweet bike, I guess I should use it a little more. Me and my roommates rode are bikes around in the snow last year up in LOCNAME, that was tight. You would never imagine how hard it is to ride a bike on a frozen pond. My roommates girlfriend is doing her laundry at our apartment right now. Its cool. I just looked at my other roommate and thought about the incredibly easy week he has had. He goes to ORGNAME and has no friday classes. He then skipped monday because he didn't have his car. Today he got out of both of his classes for some carnival they were having. He just asked me \"Travis where are we eating tonight. \"  That kind of funny because that for sure seems like the most important thing we have to do tonight. I love college. PROPNAME is now playing Granny on the listener supported dvd and its kickin. I love this song. PROPNAME and his boys rock it out in concert if you have never been. . GGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOO. LOCNAME is turning out to be pretty sweet. I love the wide variety of people you get to see on a daily basis. My last school had 0000 students so I Knew just about everyone I saw, its a little different here, but its all good. Just looked at the timer and it looks like I got about 0 minutes left. Is anyone elses computer typing on like a 0 second delay?  Anyway its been fun writing in a constant stream of continual conscience or whatever its called. Phsycology is very interesting I really liked the lie detector test. Props to PROPNAME for tricking that thing the second time around. Just looked at the kitchen, it looks pretty clean who would have thought?  One minute left that's really all I'm thinking about right now. The class dj is good with the tunes they seem to be a sweet mix. Talk to you later peace out whoever is reading this. Bye. \nAsnwer:"
