No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: okay I\u2019m writing this stream of consciousness things and it's 00:00 and god my roommate is sick as hell she's got this nasty head cold and I hope my typing isn't keeping her up god I wish people wouldn't pound their feet when they go up and down the stairs I wonder if my computer was a bad idea when I decided to place it right by the window oh god I think I am bothering my roommate she just sat up but now she's laying back down again I wonder if I\u2019ll get cold tonight with the fan on cause a cold fronts coming through I feel a little drainage in my throat I hope I\u2019m not catching my roommates cold oh god I hope tomorrow wont be boring or mundane god it's only 00:00 I never realized how hard it is to write for 00 minutes this mouse pointer is annoying me I want to move it but I don\u2019t want to stop writing thud somebody's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh I can't stop writing because if I did it would be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school I\u2019m looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm I was mildly planning on drawing up a petition with the other girls in order to get one I was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god I can't wait to use the sorority koozie I got on bid day for some reason I don't like flashing around and advertising the fact that I\u2019m in a sorority, not that I\u2019m not proud of my sorority it's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my T-shirt I mean I\u2019m no longer PROPNAME (blank) but I am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so I\u2019d rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it's only 00:00 boy I\u2019ve never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self I wonder if I\u2019ll be able to swing this college life I mean I want to do well so well so I can prove it to my mom that I can do it yet I want to party a lot I know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because I still haven\u2019t attached the back part to my computer chair b/c this task requires me to use some tool that I don't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie, speaking of computers I put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am I proud it arrived in 0 foot 0 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section, god my eyes are starting to get tired but I really have no reason to go to bed b/c I have no classes before 00 and I\u2019m not a morning person and I already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and I don't want to be too tired to party because I\u2019ve risen before 00:00 am. so I have many incentives to not go to bed and I feel like shit if I get more than 0 hours of sleep I\u2019m one of those always got to be busy people so I can't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it is sleeping late in the morning yet I feel like a slug if I sleep to late actually I feel guilty as if I\u2019m wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching, I\u2019m so proud of myself that I am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that I\u2019m off to a good start see I just can't fathom how some girls I know are already missing class, I mean what the hell else do you have to do here but occasionally study, party, and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade, but I shouldn't necessarily jump on a soap box because I never know how long I will remain this disciplined. kick ass it's 00:00 and I\u2019m signing off! \nAsnwer:"
