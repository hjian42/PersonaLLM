    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Got a Beatles play list going in ORGNAME. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds first up. Possibly my favorite. I remember back senior year of high school, I gave PROPNAME crap for liking The Beatles. Stat bwaahaha. Moreover UIL math and science bwahaha. Hey, PROPNAME has that guy from ORGNAME ORGNAME, I think his new movie is Little Black Book. Doesn't look too good. PROPNAME PROPNAME is funny, I should take PROPNAME to see it. I should call PROPNAME sometime tomorrow before she calls me, if she calls me tomorrow. Last weekend was cool, hanging out with her like every day. Ah, PROPNAME Fields Forever next up on the play list. ;Staring at the empty Sonic bags on the floor  I like Sonic. Saw Saved yesterday, kind of hits the spot somewhere inside. Not having a religion isn't bothering me as much as I think it should, but then why should it? Still have two pages for HIS discussion tomorrow. Discussion sections for HIS, American History 0000-0000?? Just talking about history. Boring. Talking about the mind and why we think. Interesting. Ooh, good song now, Come Together. I wonder if there will be a keg tomorrow afternoon? It's always nice coming back from class, taking a nap-a-roo, grabbing some grub, and filling' up a cup. I ordered a BMX bike tonight. Ok, from that pre-screening thing today that took way way longer that 0. 0 hours, but that's probably because of my connection, it has been crappie' up all day, absolutely ridiculous, we live in an age where technical difficulties like these shouldn't be. Anywho, yeah so mark me down for a little anxious and nervous about this recent BMX online purchase tonight. I got an email verification and all but when I typed in the tracking package number, nothing showed or came up, so. A little worried. Next song,  ;drum rolls please. Let It Be. LOCNAME LOCNAME? 00. 000? Strawberry? Crazy things went down today, cops on motorcycles, people slamming into the back of other cars, anti-freeze spraying all over the place, high speed chase, people being arrested, all before logic?!?!?! You know it's sad but true. Next song, PROPNAME PROPNAME. Good commercial, ORGNAME ORGNAME, mmmmm. I should play golf sometime. I have one \"Pimp My Room\" upgrade point. I don't really mind letting my fellow co-opers use my truck, just don't mess up the trust, right? At least they lock the doors. Gas though? Other perks? Will it last all semester? All year? I find it interesting because I don't know the answer to that. Last song, Revolution. PROPNAME, the pop-up just told me my 00 minutes is up, so I'm out! \nAsnwer:"
