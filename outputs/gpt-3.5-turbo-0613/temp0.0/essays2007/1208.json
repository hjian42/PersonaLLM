My sleeping schedule has been severely altered. I stay up until 0:00 or 0:00 every night studying, then to get up at 0:00 or so to go to class. Surprisingly going back to the discussion in class, I am not especially stressed although I never seem to be. The only thing I ever stress about in PROPNAME, PROPNAME, and some of my other troubled friends. PROPNAME really is the source of all my stress right now (little as it is). I worry about him all the time. Not that I don't think he can take care of himself, because he is incredibly independent. I just think that maybe if I worry about it, it will do some good. There's my logic as usual it's very skewed. I am so incredibly tired. I can't help but think that if anyone reads this, they must be thinking that I lead the most unproductive life at LOCNAME. This really isn't the case. I just tend to sleep during the day, leaving all my studying to be done at night, and then stay up late doing that it's a vicious cycle of, well, laziness I suppose not necessarily unproductive. People can be lazy and still manage to be productive; there is a difference. This difference is vaguely present in my mind, and in my state of complete exhaustion, I am not capable of articulating it. I can't even make a coherent sentence describing my inability to articulate. I have Biology in an hourI don't want to go, but I know I will. I haven't developed that skill that comes to every college student. The one where you can miss class, and not panic, or feel remotely guilty for wasting your parents' money. I suppose this is a good thing though. I am staring at the foam brain resting on my computer speaker. There is something strangely humorous about it again; I can't even begin to articulate what it is. Just a foamy brain, portables, small, and somehow humorous. My sense of humor is rather odd. I have gathered this from several sources: the fact that PROPNAME PROPNAME is the greatest series ever made, the fact that foam brains are hilarious, and the fact that I can laugh at anything without having any real reason. Random laughter. It's good in some ways. This doesn't look like twenty minutes of writing, but I suppose that if I have been typing for twenty minutes, then this is twenty minutes worth of writing. I am so smart I amaze others and myself. \nAsnwer:"
