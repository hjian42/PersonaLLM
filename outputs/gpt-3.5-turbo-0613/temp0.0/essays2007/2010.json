No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well, Sitting here doing this assignment at 00:00 a. m. and my lazy butt just woke up. I can't believe that I wake up so late nowadays. I remember my freshman year where I slept a few hours a night and got by fine. I'm feeling a little bad about myself for not working out this morning like I wanted too. If I could just get up when I wanted to then there would be not problem. But no, I have to stay in bed until the last possible second before class. On Wed. I have my first class at noon, and I was late. How pathetic is that?  How can I not get up before the sun has reached its peak position over the city?  Typing this is making my forearm hurt a little. I first noticed that when I was shooting a basketball yesterday. I think I might have pulled something lifting weights the other day and at least worked something that I don't usually work out so it hurts a little. Is strange, I am supposed to be sitting here thinking of stuff and my mind blanks out, but when I am supposed to be concentrating, my mind decided that then is the appropriate time to start racing with ideas and contemplations not associated at all with what I am doing. I actually like this assignment, its kind of nice to just sight down and write down what I am thinking about. I tried to start a journal once but to no avail. I am not a person of habit. I cannot just dedicate myself to something at a certain time everyday or week whenever unless it is something that I have to do, such as class, or a job if I ever find one. I felt really disappointed that I could not find a job this summer. Why was I having such a hard time?  I have problems with things like that, I hate doing the first part of something, such as actually finding the job or deciding on a career. That's one of the reasons I am taking this class as a Junior, because I don't know what else to take. I can't decide what I want to do for the rest of my life. I would be so much easier if I had someone say you are going to be a business man or a teacher, take these classes, and don't suck it up like you have been doing for the first two years of your college career\". And I would be like \"OK, fine, I can do that\" and then I would do it, but probably not to the full extent of my ability. I have a hard time doing things to hardcore for an extended amount of time. I guess everyone is like that but even things I like to do, after time I start slacking, such as car audio fabrication. I like to build things out of fiberglass and my last project really sucked it up. I guess it was a learning experience but after a few days of working on it I got dismayed because it didn't look as good as I had hoped it would and finally said \"the hell with it\" and just finished it. Now I am ready to chunk it and start anew. But I like building things, so that my be the reason too. \nAsnwer:"
