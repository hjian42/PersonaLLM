It's one of my favorite things to eat. He gets somewhat annoying, though. Right now he is playing a video game, and he is got the volume turned way up. I don't mind so much; it's just hard to get my thoughts straight. I hate the way milk leaves a sour taste in your mouth. I always end up having to chew some gum or brush my teeth again, but it is so good. Everything I am saying sounds really stupid. I guess that's how the mind works though. I've never actually had to plot out my exact thoughts. Most of them just kind of run through my head, with the important ones being the only truly pondered thoughts. He (my roommate) keeps talking to his game. It's getting old. The game is cool though; a bit violent but very addictive. It even gets a little scary at night some of the time. Nights are so weird here. It always feels a lot later than it is, or not late enough. I always end up forgetting to call home and my girlfriend because by the time I remember it's too late to be calling the east coast. I don't know where my relationship with her is going. We've been dating for almost four years. Maybe I should tell my roommate that the talking gets annoying. Would that offend him though?  I don't know. I don't know about a lot of things. And I just realized that I just used the word don't know. \"  The internet lingo is getting out of hand. I used to be online almost all day long. He is still talking. At least I can look forward to the game this weekend. For once I won't mind the noise. It's kind of exciting. My first LOCNAME game. I am so bored. I really need to meet people. Being from out-of-state definitely has its downside. Everyone seems to know everybody here and that doesn't help me very much. It seems a little awkward to walk up to someone and introduce myself, but that's what I have to do or I'll be spending a lot of time in my dorm room. That, my friend, was a run off sentence, but I'm much too lazy to correct it right now. Stayed up too late last night because I don't have any classes today. I should really finish my homework after this, but I am way too lazy for that. There it goes. My roommate made me lose where I was going with that last thought. I'm kind of thirsty right now, I should get a bottle of water. The Austin water is gross. I'm definitely not feeling the fact that there are no agents in the water to clean it. We've been buying water left and right. We should really get a ORGNAME filter. This game really is addicting. I just lost all train of thought watching it for a matter of 00 seconds. I don't think that it's a good thing to do that. This whole writing is filled with vague pronoun references. My 00th grade english (is that supposed to be capitalized) would murder me if she knew I was writing like this, but I suppose it is okay as long as I don't get into the habit of writing this way. I am really slack. I'm only taking 00 hours this semester and I still don't do any homework. At least I am doing okay on my graded assignments. Oh well. This is college life and for once I'm not going to have my mom around to push me to study and do my work. The timer seems like it is moving a lot slower now than before. Just like when I'm running; it always takes so much longer for 00 minutes to pass when I'm on one the treadmill. Very dull, indeed. \nAsnwer:"
