I'm just kind of tapping they keys waiting for something to enter my head for me to write down. I'm really getting tired of hitting the backspace key because I keep typing the wrong letters. I wonder if I will get anymore mail, hopefully. Its  kind of fun opening the mail box and actually having stuff in it. I didn't know where the laundry was until last night. It sucks there is nothing cool in the north tower everything is in the south tower and that is too far for me to want to walk. The light in my room is really big and the papers on my bulletin board are waving around from my air-conditioning. Its hella hot outside, I can't wait till october or november when it will cool down. The animation on my beer poster sure is shitty, I definitely got to cover it up with other pictures, I suck at spelling, its only been 0 minutes this really does feel like forever, I really just don't have a lot to say. HA the radio just said hello to me its so polite, I'm trying to decide whether or not to turn it on. For some weird reason my roommate but an empty water bottle inside a drink cup, it kind of reminds me of abstract art, like when homer tried to build a barbeque and ended up with a big pile of bricks with an umbrella sticking out. I wonder if the ORGNAME really is the fastest road car in the world. I'm pretty fast I think I could beat it. Al pacino looks a little up set its ok though he is about to snort a whole big pile of cocaine, what a crazy guy, all this typing is making me thirsty again. Bottled water is so stupid. Why would u pay for water that somebody else just filled up out of a tap in the backroom when u can get a cup for free. some people are just idiots. People really do look funny when they cross the finish line in races. It really is a lot harder then it seems to put the top on a bottle. I wonder if I will ever use this stapler that I brought. It does make my desk look very professional though. I ate way too much pizza, rolls, fettuccine alfredo and chicken, they all really don't mix. A blue viper is cool. My hair is getting long again if my dad sees me he will be like so son when do u want me to set up an appointment for you to get your hair cut. just because his dad was a barber doesn't mean that he knows when other people need hair cuts. But my grandad did have one of those cool barber poles and my grandma always tells me what each color stands for and says one day when I'm on a tv game show they will ask me that question and I will win lots of money I think the white is for the skin, red for the blood and blue for the veins. I think. I just spilled water all over my shirt I need to work on my mouth hand coordination. but I suppose water is better then throw up. Stupid reed throwing up on my only UT shirt down in cancun. my roommate sure has some girly colored push pins    they are all pastel colors. the freeway is pretty busy right now, I wonder where everyone is going. I really did eat to much, just sitting here typing is making my stomach hurt. I need some tums. They taste like chalk though, yuck even though I have never eaten chalk before I still know what I would taste like, All dry and chalky. it really would be funny if david still went by texas time instead of LOCNAME time. \nAsnwer:"
