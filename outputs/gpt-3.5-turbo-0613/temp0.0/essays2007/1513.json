No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      lets begin. how to begin. . this is a start. a start of something undetermined. not like a coefficient. not even a matrix. although its being stored physically in memory in a linear fashin which if you dumped it to a screen it would wrap and may appear as a matrix; not like the movie. just plain ordinary hexadecimal digits; boring to the average person. or at least what i percieve to be average; this is by experience, my experince which is limited. im hingry err hungry. perhaps i just coined a new word. i should copywrite it and charge people a rediculous sum of money whenever its used. id be financially secure. no problems paying tuition in the future. everything would be perfect. well not really, that was sarcasm. what else. . bordom is begining to set in. hmmm what happened today?  well, i went to skewl and learned a few new tricks. no, i am not a dog. or a cat or mouse or flea. i had a dog when i was young though and some fish. never had a pet aligator; though they are common in the sewers in some parts of houston, my hometown. that place is awfull. funny have awe full -- which is used to describe something good -- is so similar to awfull. yadda yadda yadda hocus pocus and a bunch of other filler words go here. the oven is finished preheating. i thought i'd be lazy and eat pizza tonight. unfortunately i have to wait about 00 minutes until i can put it in the oven. if i left the computer now id be cheating wouldn't i?  who am i asking. 0. instructor, 0. teachers assistant, 0. myself, 0. some imaginary diety. hmmm undecided. well no, myself. am i vain?  not often do i think of myself as such but everything is untimately relative to me, i can only imagine what others think and feel and experience. oh well insert more garbage here. is the audience bored yet?  can they tell im bored. prolly so. i forget to tell stephanie that riley called. hopefully ill remember later when she gets home. i think i forget to tell her last time he called to. this is not good because he still needs to resolve some things with here. he is young. im old. getting older, but not as old as dirt. how old is dirt anyways?  will it ever evolve into something else? we'll make great pets. i never went to lalapalooza. sister did, car broke down and so they hitched a ride the rest of the way there. crazy dangerous and fun all at the same time i suppose. i usually play things safe which result in alot of missed opertunities. at least i think so. but this is not as true as it used to be. some of my friends think im a bit strage. sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. bad religion. from the grey race i think. my best friend in high skool was a big fan of them. i fooled around with his girlfriend one night and have regretted it ever since. told him the next day about it. he was glad, he wanted rid of her anyways. funny how things work out sometimes. my grammer is horrible. hagar the horrible wasa comic i read in the newspaper when i was little. hocus focus was my favorite though. i remember easter at my grandmothers and getting stung by a wasp. meat tenderizer in a wonderfull thing. a0 sauce not equals meat tenderizer. i like c. its for cookie and is a bad ass programming language. maybe i spend to much time staring into electron guns. crts have got to be bad for my vision. maybe that why i need contact. laser surgery sounds pretty good. still the long term effects are unknown. whats the worst that could happen?  my eyes fall out of their sockets and i have to put ping pong balls in there instead?  my friends could call me muppet man!  i really do find that amusing. a bit morbid, but amuzing nonetheless. 0 minutes to go until this assignment is done. then i can put the pizza in the oven the wait another 00 minutes til i can eat. please don't feel guiltly for making me wait. humans can go for a few days without food or so i am told. i do not known from experience. still i am hungry. the hunger is a band i never saw play in concert. i did see lucious jackson. that was great fun. i had a shiney dead fish toy that everyone liked. the band kept looking at it while they played on stage with a confused look on their face \nAsnwer:"
