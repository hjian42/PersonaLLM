I feel really bad for not going, it's the first class I've missed so far. It was only Calculus-I'm not having any trouble in that class so far. I'm having the most trouble in Chemistry. I hate Chemistry. I almost wish my major was different so that I wouldn't have to take it. I took it in high school and I had trouble with it there. College is so much better than high school. Everyone said that once I was in college, I would wish I was back in high school-I don't wish that yet!  I really hated high school I'm so glad I'm not there anymore. Senior year was the worst-especially towards the end. I did so bad in school then. I can't believe I still got into LOCNAME. I didn't think I was going to get in. I remember when I found out-it was a Wednesday night and I made my brother check my status at LOCNAME on the internet. he didn't want to because I had been making him check it everyday for the past week and it always said that they were still reviewing my application. this time it said they had accepted me we were so excited no on e was there though just me, my brother and my boyfriend- he was asleep on the couch though and I woke him up to tell him and he didn't even act like he cared he just kind of grunted and went back to sleep-he's always like that though he never thinks anything I do that I'm proud of is really all that great anyway the night I found out was the night before me my brother my boyfriend and my best friend left for spring break vacation in LOCNAME LOCNAME. That vacation was so fun!! except I was sick the whole time so that sucked the food was so gross \nAsnwer:"
