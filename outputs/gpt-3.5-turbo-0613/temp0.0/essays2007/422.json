No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: At the dorm where I live there is a girl that is Anorexic, and we all call her PROPNAME for short. This s probably the rudest thing that you could ever possibly do to a person in this state, but then she doesn't know that we call her this. I am also confused about guys, and why they react the way they do. My friend told me the weirdest story about her weekend today. She said that she was dancing in a club and this really big guy started pissing on her leg, and then her boyfriend hit the guy right in the sweet spot, and the bouncers kicked her boyfriend out instead of the pisser. That is so not fair and disgusting!  I can not believe that someone would actually do that in the middle of a crowd of people. Anyway I really do not know what to talk about because I am really tired. I slept today for about two hours, and now I am more tired than I was before. I ate lunch at LOCNAME today and I had Alligator for the first time. It was really good and it kind of tasted like chicken. Well I just talked to my boyfriend on the phone and he told me that one of the guys he used to work with died today in a high speed car accident. The funeral is on Tuesday, and he wants me to go with him because he can not cope with it by himself. I have a problem with dead people and funerals, and I swore that after my grandpa died, I would never go to another funeral. Well I really want to see a movie pretty soon, because I haven't seen one in a long time. I really need to see the Horse Whisperer, because I heard that it was a really good movie! \nAsnwer:"
