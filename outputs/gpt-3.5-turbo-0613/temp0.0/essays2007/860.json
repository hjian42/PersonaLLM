No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I just got back from LOCNAME and all I can think about is getting ready for this week's classes. I had a good time witj my girlfriend and got to spend quality time with my parents. I hope I can get tickets to the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert next week. I need to study a lot this week so I can keep on top of my classes and not get behind in anything. Thursday night I hope I go to PROPNAME PROPNAME's again. I'ts fun not having Friday classes so I can go out on Thursday nights . I love college: I feel so free; free as a bird: to come and go as I please. I'm doing pretty well in my classes thus far and hope to continue on. LOCNAME football dominated ORGNAME. They didn't have a chance. However my favorite college football team is ORGNAME. They whipped LOCNAME last week and killed LOCNAME this week -00-00. Now they have their eyes set on LOCNAME in two weeks : and I plan to go on-line and bet about $00 on that game: in psu's favor of course. Hopefully they will win the national championship. I also hope that ORGNAME does well because they are my second favorite team. I really need my 0. 0 Gpa this term so I can get into the business school. I don't know what I will do if I don't get in. I am really interested in studying business and hope to own my own business someday. God I miss my girlfriend: I've only been away from her for like ten hours now but I already realize that I miss her so much. We've been going strong now for like a year and a half, and I love her so much. She's still a senior in high school and I hope that next year she will come to UT. She makes good enough grades so I think she can get in. Sometimes I miss my parents but I'm having a good time thus far. I I have made so many friends. Ut is going to kill ORGNAME this weekend : but too bad it is in LOCNAME LOCNAME. I want to watch them play live since I missed their game last week cause I was back home in LOCNAME. however I did watch them on T. V . So here I sit on this computer at 00:00 typing and typing staring off into space. I wish I knew what would happen in my future, I wish I knew. Who knows : its all in God's hands now. He is the one who will watch over me and guide me on the right path. I am taking creatine while I work out. Since I started taking it I've gained 00 pounds of muscle. It might be bad for me in the long run but for right now its worth it \nAsnwer:"
