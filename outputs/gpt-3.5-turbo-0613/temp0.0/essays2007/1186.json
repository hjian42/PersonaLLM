No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well right now it's 00:00 and I am thinking I'll be out of here in about twenty minutes and then I'll get something to eat, I feel very hungry it is probably because I didn't eat much last night or this morning, anyway I just remembered I have to cut the grass today what a pain. by the time I get home I am going to be so tired that I would just want to go to bed but no I have to cut the grass I guess I should forget about going to the gym today even though I promised myself I will go to the gym every Tuesday and Thursday. but o well at least I don't have to work today thinking about work I remembered there is that boat party next weekend that should be a lot of fun I haven't been to the lake for couple of months now, we used to go every week. it seems like a long time but it has only been about 0 minutes that I have been writing. I wander if I should return my study guide for calculus. I don't know if I need it or not. I am sure it will come in handy when doing homework but it is not required to have and it costs. I don't know maybe 00 dollars. It makes the job easier but at the same time I have to learn and try instead of just copying off the study guide. that was pretty nice of that guy giving me his psychology book for free I don't even know him. I was willing to pay half how much he paid for it but o well I probably should give him a gift card of some sort. Maybe I'll get one from work like a 00 dollar gift certificate. I feel kind of dizzy. I went to sleep late and then I had to wake up at seven to catch the bus and get here for my 0:00 discussion class to find out that they just covered the problem that I had questions about. and now I have been here at the lab for couple of hours string at screen doing my assignments for my computer science class. My eyes are getting pretty tired and the screen is becoming harder to focus on. I don't think this is good on my eyes definitely not. Well so far sitting here doing this has been the most fun I have had so far today, but still I just can't wait to get out of here. But hey where am I going to go? go to the bookstore and return the book? Or go to library and study for my macroeconomics class? maybe go to the gym ? no I am hungry I probably should get something to eat I don't know if I should call PROPNAME see if she wants to go get something to eat but she is probably sleep. I could call PROPNAME, I have to call somebody because I hate eating by myself. \nAsnwer:"
