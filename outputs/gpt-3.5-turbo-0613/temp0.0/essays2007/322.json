My friend PROPNAME was just talking to me. I better drop my Geography, because that class is boring. I don't even read  the book because it's so boring. I hope I can drop it before the date where I  get a full refund. My Dad might get mad, but oh well. I think I'll go home  this weekend and work for my Dad because I need some money. I hope he's working. My hand hurts already. I can't study here. I can't wait until I get home. Sometimes I just love being by myself. Man, my friend PROPNAME needs to get a job. It's like I'm running a daycare center. He's always at my house and he never goes to school. He just plays on my Playstation all day. \nAsnwer:"
