No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I hate the miami dolphins and jimmy johnson, always smacking his lips. the broncos suck with out elway and not the dolphins will win. god I hate the dolphins. I miss erin so much, I hope I can stay faithful to her. everyone makes me feel stupid for staying with her when she is still in high school, but she is only 0 hours away. I can hardly wait till she comes down this weekend. I could not be more stressed, tests and other crap are bogging me down. it is so hard to make friends here that I feel comfortable around and that is only making me more nervous and stressed. I hate my rtf class, it is stupid and pointless. the reading is so painful I can barely stand to do it. dammit the dolphins scored again! I hate the dolphins! thank god almighty the cowboys won,I would have had a heart attack if they had lost, I miss my friends so much. I can hardly wait to see them in a month. there are so many damn hippies around here, sometimes they are entertaining but they are mostly just annoying. DAMN I HATE THE DOLPHINS. my phone bill is going to be huge from talking to erin, my parents are going to kill me. I feel pressured to entertain her friends this weekend and that I also stressing me out. my room needs to be cleanded badly, this place is disgusting. why can't erin just be here now, if she went here my life would be next to perfect. \nAsnwer:"
