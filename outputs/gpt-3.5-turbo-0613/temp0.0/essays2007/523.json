The whether showed how I actually felt inside. kind of sad, glum, & anxious. It was hard for me to leave LOCNAME at first, but now that I'm settled in and have started classes now I feel somewhat better. I miss what I've left behind, what is familiar to me, my friends, family, pets, and yes, my radio station 00. 0 THE BOX. I love LOCNAME and will go back to live there again one day. I also miss my house, my room, and my bed too. It was kind of like my comfort zone. Whenever I had a problem or felt sad about something, I could hide in my room, my parents would try to comfort me and I would sleep away my problems. Well, I know sleeping doesn't solve your problems but it sure makes them seem not so bad after a nap. Now that I am in college, I will have to keep my head up and make new friends so I can lean on them when I need a shoulder or helping hand. I also feel anxious about meeting new people and talking to my professors. At first, to someone new, I might seem kind of shy, but once they get to know me they can see how I really open up and seem a little crazy too!  But it's sometimes hard for me at first to open up to someone and just be myself. I don't know why, it just depends on how I feel at the time I guess. There's also a little bit of fear inside me that makes me feel doubtful as to whether I will find my \"niche\" or my group of friends that I can hang out with. I have ran into a couple of my friends from highschool that I have been doing things with lately and that makes me feel good. Whether or not I want to join a sorority is something that I will deal with next year. If they seem cliquish and stuck up, I don't think I want to join one. maybe I'll go rushing and see what they're all about and then make my choice. I'm also curious about what I will get out of my college experience. Will I find my future husband here or get a good job right after I graduate?  Will I struggle the whole way and stick it out, or will I give up and drop out?  Just to let you know, I plan on doing my best and graduate in a couple of years. I have already been to each of my classes once and my mind is about to explode with all the information that was given to me. The professors told us what to do and gave us a syllable, now it is up to us to do it on our own time and to manage it wisely. I seem to think that it will be hard to keep track of all my assignments and homework. I hope I can stay organized throughout the year and not fall behind in any of my classes. I feel like I could get lost easily at such a big university with so many students. On the other hand I do have some positive emotions about college and my new experiences. I have a fresh start at a new life (with no parents!) and I can be whatever I want to be and do whatever I want to do. There are so many things on campus and in LOCNAME to get involved with and do. and the good thing is that it is my choice!  I just hope I don't blow it!  \nAsnwer:"
