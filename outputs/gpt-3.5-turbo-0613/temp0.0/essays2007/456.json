He left this morning. We saw him off. His mom was there so the send off wasn't so bad. The other guys are afraid to show emotion. They've got this macho, I'm afraid to feel attitude. They're smart and all but maybe not as expressive as my close friends back home. Guess that comes with time. The cheebye had to leave so damned fast. 0 week and one day's notice was all he had. And all of us, especially me, feel so betrayed. We had great plans for this summer and the fall. At least I'll be seeing him in december when I fly back home. I like stuffed toys. Beanie babies rock! but. I have to watch my spending, yeah, too many beanies'll break my bank! college isn't all that cheap. I'm not a  loaded person. I've got to think about my budget for this month. sheesh, I've  already overspent and am going to be stretched till october. cheebye!  I wonder if anybody's going to read this rambling. if somebody is, hmmmm. you can  call me. I'm \"new\" to america and don't have any american friends. sad isn;t it? but that is the case. what's the point of going overseas for an education if you  don't imerse youself into the country's culture.   oh well. I've got lot's of things to do now. like get my \"lunch\". I'm starving. hmmm.              \nAsnwer:"
