No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I am thinking of all the things I have to get done today and how I don't' have anything else to think about. there is so much to get done here and I only got behind one day. dang it this reminds me that I haven't gone to mezes to sign up for anything yet. so I better go get that done tomorrow. RTF reading. shakespeare reading. psych reading. bio reading. art history reading and journal. dang, I guess I could do some of it during dinner, but I told PROPNAME that I'd go with her. I woldn't want to be rude so I guess I'll do it all when I come back. mm, dinner. I'm hungry. wonder what we are having. it better be better than lunch. at least the salad bar was stocked up. I hate it when its not because that is one of the only safe options that there is. Mark comes up to see me on Saturday. I wonder if we'll ever get any alone time. I hope he gets here late because I'll need to sleep during the day because of my pledge retreat on Friday/sat morning. OH I need to call someone about a sleeping bag. shoulld write a note about that, would if I weren't typing all my thoughts out. this is weird. I've never had to do anything like this. wonder if 00 minutes is up, nope 0 minutes. I think a lot in 0 minutes. maybe that is why I talk so much. probably. anyway. I wonder what is on comedy central. I shouldn't turn the tb on because then I won't be thinking anything at all. I'll be all zombie. I'm feeling such frustration now because I really don't want to be doing this and I have only been typing for like 0 minutes. I should have done this much earlier when I was feeling okay and had stuff to think about. now all I have to think about it complaining because I don't feel well, don't want to be doing this and I'm hungry and don't want to eat cafeteria food. hey I could order a pizza, but don't really want to spend my money. I should get a job. Wonder if I can fit 00 hrs of work into my schedule. lets see if I worked 0 hrs that's only 0 days of work. no I really don't want to do so much right now. I'll wait till next semester till I have a better idea on what I am doing and how to handle college life. plus I have meetings on 0 days of the week. maybe 0 if I do rha. but teachign dance again woudl be fun. I could contact them and just talk to them. yeah I think I'll do that tomorrow. plus it will keep me in shape. since I'm not taking any dance training right now. about 0 more minutes then I can go eat. I also need to get a haircut. I'll do that tomorrow too. oh and I need to get this printer working. maybe I'll wait till mark comes so I don't screw it up. yeah I think that's what I'll do. only about 0 more whole days till he gets here. I wonder if we are doing the right thing by staying together while at college. It feels right but it sure does hurt when we have to leave. And what is a healthy amount of time to see each other that we won't be intruding?  I don't want ot not see him but I want ot have a life of my own here and its hard to get involved when you are with your boyfriend all the time. maybe I'll drag him to that party on sat. I think he'll have fun. I should really ask first before I make plans. I'm rambling. I always ramble. kerri is done with her psych. I should start mine after I get done with this assignment and the other one. I really hope the other one is easier than this one. if my head wasn't so foggy maybe I wouldn't ramble so much. but then I ramble when I talk too so nevermind. my throat still hurts. I hope that goes away soon. it sucks to be sick when you have so much studying to do not to mention the other things I have to get doen. I should make me a list. I think I'll do that after I eat. k almost done  I hope I didn't make katrina mad when I didn't write back to her. I guess she'll have to just understand that I have way too much to do. oh well. I wonder when it'll get cold. I can't stand this hot weather and its so freezing it the room that I have to wear a long sleeved shirt. but then again maybe its just because I'm sick. wonder if kerri is also cold. oh the 00 minuts is up. food. \nAsnwer:"
