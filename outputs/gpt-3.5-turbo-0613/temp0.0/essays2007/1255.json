No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: At the moment, the only thing that is going through my mind is how I will make it through college if I remain a procrastinator. Thus, I am completing this assignment because I feel that I need to make changes in my study habits. Moreover, I need to succeed at UT because I cannot afford to let my parents down. My parents have worked exceptionally hard to obtain their current status; it would be a total waste of their time and my time and of course, a total waste of money if I fail in college. Thus, failing is not possible. Occasionally, I ponder whether or not my parents see me as a failure. At times, I feel, as though, I am a failure because I am constantly being compared to my older brother. Everything that I do is not good enough and that I should be more like my brother; I guess one could say that I am always in my brother's shadow. Moreover, it is not only my parents that make the comparisons, but my aunts and uncles also make similar comparisons to other family children. Because they do this, I constantly feel depressed for short periods of time. In order to cope with this, I am apt to finding companionship and understanding through several short love relationships. Each of these \"flings\" can be sought as a substitute for happiness. However, I am now more knowledgeable about stuff like that because I know that these relationships are fun and all, but this relationships only make things worse. Not to mention that they only help you obtain temporary happiness. There is one thing good that has come of these experiences; I believe that I have found happiness with another. She makes me happy in all aspects of life and she actually seems to care about me for who I am and not someone else. When I am around her, she encourages me spiritually whether or not she does it intentionally. Surprisingly enough, she actually understands me without having me to explain anything; I guess you can say she's my soul mate, but there is one thing I am sure of, I love her with all my heart. In fact, she has been the only girl I have actually told that I love her and actually meant it. Just thinking about it at the moment makes me smile. \nAsnwer:"
