No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Throughout my life I have experienced many important events in which have shaped the way of my future. for example, when first arriving at ORGNAME I was awe-inspired by the size of the campus, and the enormous amounts of students which attended. I was shocked by the different races which represented each other. I could tell that everyone was already forming their own little \"clicks\", whether it was based on their interests in music, race, sex, sexual orientation, everyone was already making new friends, and social gathering were taking place. While everyone was socializing I was busy worrying about the classes that I was taking, the assignments that were supposed to be done in classes that I had. I was lonely, I was scared, and being from a large city, I was trying to adapt to an even larger one. although LOCNAME is a beautiful campus it offers more than just a decent education it offers a variety of things, for example, the opposite sex,new friends, and just having a good time, while at the same time, studying. I knew coming to ORGNAME that I would have a good education, but I needed a way to find myself, who I was, and what I wanted to study, I came to LOCNAME wanting to be a doctor, but I figured that it may not be something I wanted to do. perhaps becoming a professor would strike my fancy, at some time in my college education, but whatever it is that I may become I want it to be something that I am going to be happy doing. I realized that high school is much different that college. college is much more demanding, and time consuming. but in the end it will even out someday. When I was a child I had dreams of being a great military leader. a policeman. a astronaut. or a physicist. as of now I don't know what I want to become I'm still trying to find something that will interest me greatly. as a child I always wanted to do something that related to the field of science thats why I wanted to become a doctor. but now that I'm in psychology I've realized that it is much more than the study of the mind. but how it works and functions. in science I have always wanted to contribute something that will interest others. for example in psychology, it would be interesting to someday find a cure to depression. or just find a way to make everyone happy, in the event that I would someday accomplish something like this, I would make sure that everyone would reap the rewards of a healthy lifestyle. knowing that I have contributed something to the art of science would be enough for my to tell my grandchildren one day. now that I am more relaxed here at UT it is easier for me to meet new people and get around campus faster. finding the shortcuts. and finding which classes are the best. all the time when I first discovered what comes along with a great education. i have also figured out that I can become whatever I want to be. just as long as I put my mind to it. and test out my skills as a academian. coming to UT I knew would offer a lot of new and important things to me. i knew that with hard work and determination. i could accomplish whatever I wanted to. conquering my thoughts has been something that has always been a goal of mine. overpowering myself, knowing that I can't always tell myself what to do all the time. and just let my unconscious mind take over. often times when I become depressed I find that it is easier to listen to soothing music. talking with a friend. or playing chess with a friend. or playing cards with them. at times I just want to take a walk or listen to the outside or hear the rain as it pours down so easily. when I do find myself depressed I always try and do something productive so that it will get off my mind. and think about other things. such as playing basketball. playing baseball. or like I said playing a good game of chess with my friends. i havent quite yet found my niche at UT but it will come someday. and I too will find my interests in academics. and find something that I truly love doing. whether it be my major now. such as biology or even psychology. as a kid I remember pouring through my fathers materials. because he to was a psych major and he understood how the mind worked and how we get along with our environments. and how we socially interact on a daily basis with nature. all along I thought I always knew what I wanted to do when I got older but I guess its an answer I will learn in time. ??? \nAsnwer:"
