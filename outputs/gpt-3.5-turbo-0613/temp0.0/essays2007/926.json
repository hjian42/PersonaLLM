For some reason, I recently discovered old rock, specifically the group ORGNAME ORGNAME. Their songs evoke strange feelings of relaxation within me. Why though? I suppose the smoothness of the words accompanied by the awesome guitar. I am reminded of the lyrics \"so do you think you can tell, Heaven and Hell, Blue skies from pain, can you tell a green field, from a cold steel rail?  A smile from a veil?  Do you think you can tell?. cold comfort for change. how I wish you were here, were just two lost soles swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, running over the same old ground, but have we found the same old fears, wish you were here. \" PROPNAMEPROPNAME PROPNAME's song \"Wish You Were Here. \"      I find myself relaxed yet down though. I am disturbed somewhat from the words; but, why am I feeling relaxed. I think it is from the awesome music and pitch of the singer's voice. Their exotic, at least to me, beginning seems to subliminally evoke depth of thinking even though the words may seem stupid. But, the part of the song I enjoy the most is the fishbowl analogy. I think it is ingenious and I am reminded of myself and my inability to find the right girl of my dreams. For some reason, the analogy portion evokes a sort of chivalric ambition within me. I desire a bit of love and romance from a special person that I want to meet. the perfect girl. Someone with the same aspirations as me. A person that when I look into her eyes I find myself lost. Yet, physically, the act of looking into her eyes would have no physical affect to me in the real world. silly.      Anyway, I am aware that PROPNAME PROPNAME took drugs and were possibly high while writing this song. I do not condone to taking drugs. In fact I dispise drugs. They ruin lives and for what. So you can loose your mind for a couple of minutes and kill yourself. The best way to counter drugs is not to try them at all. Abstinence from drugs and getting drunk is the best things in life, at least I think so. I don't need to get myself drunk at a party to have a good time. I just need to go regularly and I will have an awesome time. I am reminded of a party I went to a few weeks back. This is a disco party where you dance with girls. I went to the party and was dancing and having a good time. Unfortunately, the other guys needed to get drunk to dance. So, they all went outside to get drunk and came back in. They were the biggest loosers I have ever seen in my life. I suppose they don't have enough self esteem to go out and dance with the girls. Unfortunately, I feel that I miss out because I tend to do the right thing. That is why I am rarely invited to parties. In my whole highschool experience, I have only been to two parties. Pathetic huh!     Anyway I look forward to college to meet some nice girls that will like me for being myself, the good guy. This paper will self destruct after you read it! just kiddin' \nAsnwer:"
