I feel that i'm so far behind in my studies that i won't be able to catch up. I haven't gotten all my books and my classes are fairly hard this year. I'm usually a guy that stays on top ORGNAME things and likes to have the headstart, but it seems like I'm not on top of things. I have to get my microeconomic book from my friend later tonight so i can begin reading for that class. I should be on chapter three already, but i have yet to begun. I'm in LOCNAME right now, my hometown, and is about to leave around four. Home was a nice time to relax and enjoy my old friends again. Most of the time I was home finding myself doing absolutely nothing. I find that LOCNAME is not as fun as it was. Things are starting to change. My views and my emotions are quite different than before. I view my parents and my brother differently. I appreciate their company more than i did before. I guess I just miss them an awful lot. My brother and I are very close, and i try to talk to him every night when i'm not living in LOCNAME. I enjoy talking to him and sharing my thoughts and my experiences. I'm also kind of glad that I am going back to LOCNAME later today. I missed alot while I was gone. A friend's birthday party, ORGNAME's first football game, and a Chinese Bible Study meeting that i was hoping to attend. I can gladly say that I don't regret comming to LOCNAME and being back home. I enjoyed it fairly well. Suddenly, I feel like a sense of burden lifted from my shoulder. I'm not really thinking about my school work and homework that I should be doing, but I have a smile on my face. A sense of peace and a sense of sadness that I'm going to depart from this wonderful place I call home. Both my parents are home right now and my mom is making her best dishes for me. I can smell it from upstairs. I haven't quite missed my mother's cooking yet, but i know i will in the comming months. ORGNAME of ORGNAME is not what I had in mind. It is not as fun and exciting as I thought it would be. All my friends go there, but there seems to still be an emptiness. I guess things will get better as time progresses. I'm still not use to the freedom that I have and still not use to other things. I have also found out that I have not spoken to many of my close friends, or even hung out with them. I rather just be around those that I feel more comfortable around. The people at ORGNAME are nice thus far, I have met variety of new faces and do throughly enjoy their company. I enjoy making new friends and meeting new people. I have learned that friendships are very important. Since I use to move alot, from places to places, I have learned how to make friends and still be myself. I feel like I have lost a good friend of mine from high-school. I was very close to him and we were like brothers. Now, in college, it seems like he doesn't even want to hang out with me, but rather with his girlfriend. My friend has never dated before, but now is dating. He spends alot of time with her, and does various activities with her that i strongly disapprove. I really want him to continue to be my friend, but it just seems so hard when he doesn't put his efforts into the friendship. I hope this is not the end of our friendship, and i'm not going to give up on it. College will be a time for me to learn and expererience things that I will never experience before. Sceanarios that i have no idea how to solve and trials that will make me into the future PROPNAME PROPNAME. \nAsnwer:"
