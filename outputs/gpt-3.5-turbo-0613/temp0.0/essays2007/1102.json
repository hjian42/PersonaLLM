It angers me that it is sold out. I am now thinking about this assignment. It comes to me that I would very much like to make a superb grade in all my classes. I think that perhaps I shall if I apply myself. I am glad to think that I can do well in school. My thoughts now focus around a girl in my philosophy class who has the cutest face I think I've ever seen. I am trying to figure out a way to talk to her. I think it will have to be classrelated. There are two other girls in that class that I think are attractive. The class itself is very fun as well. I have a lot of work to do this weekend. I suppose I should get straight to it when I get home from class today. Damn, I have to work out. I used to dislike working out because of the physical discomfort, but now it's merely an issue of time. Time is the one commodity I am exceedingly greedy with. I am now thinking about how to best manage my time this weekend. I am more or less caught up in this psychology class; I now have more time to work on the others. I think I will get caught up on reading in English, and then turn in my paper. I paused for a moment there in my writing. I was thinking about what it was I was going to do today in the gym. I realized it was leg day. Leg day is excruciating, but short. Oh well, I will live. My thoughts wander back to women. I would very much like to get better acquainted with all kinds of women on a casual level. I need to expand my pool of female friends. Even as we speak, a plan of action comes to mind. School makes it easy to meet new people. I simply have to turn off my shyness. I paused AGAIN in my writing. I was thinking about the study section in computer science I was about to go to today. The LOCNAME in that study section speaks very poor English. I will go because I understand the code he puts on the board enough that I am well ahead of his thinking during that hour. The other students are not so fortunate. I figure that they'll survive. The class is a breeze. It is not very challenging, unfortunately, but I am learning a bit. \"Easy Learning I call it. \" Ack, the image of a naked female just popped into my head out of nowhere. Why did that happen? Sometimes chaotic thoughts pop out of nowhere for me. At any rate, I am now thinking about what I should eat before class. Cereal. When in doubt, you cannot go wrong with cereal. Hmm, still struggling to get that nude image out of my head. I don't need distractions right now. I need a clear, controlled mind. I am thinking of how much I have in my bank account and how I will manage my finances this month. I am somewhat poor. This will change when I graduate, but for the meantime. poverty. I'd like to think that I can be rich one day. I can see myself driving nice cars, living in a nice place, and wearing nice clothes. I can see myself managing my own time, and I can see myself being satisfied as far as that goes. Money isn't so important to me, but freedom of time is, and the only way I can see myself having free time is being wealthy. Oh well. C'est la Vie. It seems my time is about up, but my closing thoughts dwell on responsibility and what it is I plan to do in school. \nAsnwer:"
