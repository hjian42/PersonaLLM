No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: will the cowboys win this game, who knows, why even care, will I be approved for a credit card application that I just filled out? I wonder if I'm going to be called by a friend to eat lunch, I'm not hungry, because I just ate, not really in the mood for jester food, stomach hurts a little from working out yesterday, not too bad, I hope I do good in all my classes this year. theres a lot of dust in my room. I need to get my friend to make his business run better. hes not a good business man. I get him all his business. I need to clean my room, at least my side. I don't know why I bought my caller id thing, I don't even have caller id service. it wouldnt help much anyway. I want to watch the game, but I have to write this assignment. I wonder what I will do today. I want to visit some friends. I wonder why I can wake up so early and all my friends sleep so late. cowboys are doing good this game, since I can hear the game going on. I wish I had a source of income right now. I don't know how I am going to pay for my cell phone bill and the money for the frat I'm rushing for. I'm glad I didnt drink last night, I feel pretty good today, except for a running nose. wow my 00 minutes are almost done, I wonder if my parents are going to call today. I need my cell phone back from my friend. I wonder what this blue, stringy dust is that is all over my stuff. oh look, my time is up, finally I'm done wit this, I'm glad I remembered to do this today. \nAsnwer:"
