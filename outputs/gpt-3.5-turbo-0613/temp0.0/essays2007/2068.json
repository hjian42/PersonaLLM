No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: hahaha, I really like the directions of how to tell PROPNAME PROPNAME our UT EID and such. I wonder if that is weird to him. PROPNAME is an interesting name, you don't here that every day. its a good thing there's a clock on here, I didn't look to see the time for this assignment. I don't really know what to think. I'm thirsty. my roommate needs to control the noise from her computer, its annoying. my face itches. there goes the noise again. I need to clean my side of the room. why do I have so many cords on my desk, but my roommate has maybe 0?  I think I have a rash on my arm, and it itches. I need to go return my nutrition book to the co-op. eew, a duck on tv has oil all over it. what is the purpose of this commercial?  DAWN?!  that's stupid. that girl from Everybody Loves PROPNAME is a spokesperson for too many things, and when I say too many, I mean 0 different companies. but that's still odd. to me. my arm still itches. I never did anything about being thirsty. wow, I never realized how long 00 minutes is. all of this was written in 0 min:00 sec. CRAZY!  is dr pennebaker really going to read this?  I wonder how many crazy people he has in his class thinking about obscure things. too bad I couldn't do this while I'm driving, I think of some really random things when I'm in the car by myself. I like alone time. I love driving home to LOCNAME by myself, PLENTY of thinking time. I need to go to ORGNAME. but I don't remember what for. hmm. why did I need to go?  this is going to bug me. I think I want to be a ORGNAME ORGNAME. the informational meeting is at 0 tonight. I wonder if I'll make it by the time I finish this. I just noticed that I capitalize random letters. well, they're not random because if it's capitalized, its supposed to be. but I don't capitalize everything that needs to be. so that's weird. I wish I could think of more interesting things. I miss my boyfriend travis. TV without sound is funny. mmhmm I love this bar, this song makes me laugh. I really do wish I were more entertaining for you dr. I love dr pepper. I wish I knew someone named dr pepper. my orthopedic dr is named dr payne. I had a teacher in high school named mrs payne. and mr axe. can you imagine what kind of torture my high school was?  no, I loved high school. I love the fact I'm out!  I still miss my boyfriend. I wonder how many times I think about him during the day. I should start keeping tally. nah, that would be a waste of ink. country singers make me laugh. MUCH cooler than pop stars - they're all stuck up. but man, country singers and music lovers. so funny. hahahaha, this music video is funny. I laugh at things easily. people like being friends with me because I laugh easily. it boosts their self confidence I think. my arm still itches. I wish that pretesting thing would work so I can start on that. that meeting is in 00 minutes. should I go?  yeah I'll go. 0 more minutes in this assignment. I still wish I were more interesting though. the guy in this video just poured a latte on himself. now my leg itches. I love the band LOCNAME. back to the arm. soooooo, basically this was filled with how my body itches. I bet that's interesting. there goes my head. what's with that?  I don't understand. I don't think I usually itch this much. I dunno, maybe I do. my stomach just made a noise. 00 more seconds. lalalalalalalalalala. and PROPNAME PROPNAME BAND rules! :) have a great day! \nAsnwer:"
