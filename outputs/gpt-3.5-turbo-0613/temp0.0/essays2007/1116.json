I am looking down at my watch right now to check the current time. It is 0:00, and unfortunately I have to miss my calculus discussion class at 0:00 due to a chemistry review for a test I have on Thursday, the 00th. PROPNAME, a string quartet who plays music written by the rock group ORGNAME, is actually playing on my computer while I write this. I am also ripping one ORGNAME my compact discs via my computer so I can listen to it while not actually having the CD in the ROM drive. Sometimes I like to think about how technology has changed in the last few years. It is absolutely incredible. In junior high school, I had no idea what the Internet was, nevertheless how to use it. Now, I sit at my computer and I will turn in this paper simply by pasting it into a box and clicking a small button. How does the information get to the desired location? I suppose the words are somehow converted into 0s and 0s using the binary number system. Still, the entire concept is simply amazing. What is in store for technology in the future? Hover cars? Now there is a concept. I come from LOCNAME, which is not only the most polluted city in the LOCNAME LOCNAME but also has a mighty big traffic problem. I think I will switch my music to PROPNAME. There we go. Anyway, with the help of cars that \"float\" above other vehicles, pileups would be significantly less common. However, there would probably be more accidents, for the concept of cars above a driver adds a completely new depth to driving. Now instead of just having to watch in front, back, and adjacent, one would now have to be careful of who was above him. This would definitely cause some major problems. Maybe hover cars are not such a good idea. The song has now switched to PROPNAME's LOCNAME. My friend PROPNAME has the score to this piece at his dorm at the ORGNAME of ORGNAME because he is a music major. A bunch of my friends and I are going to see the PROPNAME PROPNAME concert in LOCNAME in a couple of days. I have seen the ORGNAME perform two previous times at the LOCNAME LOCNAME, and they were incredible. However, the band has not come out with an album containing new songs in quite a while. They will be coming out with a new album very soon, so I assume they will play many songs from this album in this concert coming up. Well, twenty minutes has just expired, so I will sign off now. \nAsnwer:"
