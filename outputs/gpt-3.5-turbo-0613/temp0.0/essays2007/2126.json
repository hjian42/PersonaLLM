O no 00 sec! er. er. what am I supposed to type. this is kinda stupid. ah! phone! must not answer. must not answer! hi PROPNAME! er. talking to PROPNAME. typing with one hand. not thinking straight. can't multi-task. Ah! 0min 00 sec! hang up PROPNAME! hang up! eeek. panicking! Talking about tomorrow's chem Exam. Man, didn't even know until just a few minutes ago when PROPNAME called to remind me. Hm. I should start studying right after I finish this. I got to get more organized and responsible. I wonder what other peoples thoughts are like, I watched What Women Want not too long ago, that is a very interesting movie. it says a lot about how women think. I wonder if any of it is actually true. wouldn't it be nice to know what women are thinking. I would like that power, I can never really tell what they are thinking. my room mate is watching an anime with cute girl voices and drama. I think it's called LOCNAME LOCNAME or something like that. reminds me of Fruits basket. o well, hm. there never seems to be adiquet lighting around my work area. maybe I should get another light, my room mate is laughing. the anime sounds funny, making all those funny anime noises. I miss something. I don't know what. I should call An-Vi earlier today, I think she was kind of disappointed that I didn't call her the other day. I wonder how college is like for her in ORGNAME, she says it is nice and all, but I bet there are a lot of good looking guys there. heh, what am I talking. thinking about. shouldn't worry. hm. I wonder. don't know what I'm wondering, PROPNAME's thoughts were much better I think, mine are just not really relevant. ice cream. why? I don't know. being influenced by others thoughts :p o well. need more water, can't drink water from first few weeks of school. I miss hugging her. I feel lonely. don't know why, there are a lot of pretty girls in LOCNAME LOCNAME, a lot of asians. wonder why everyone likes to party so much. mom always says that there will be someone for me, there are tons of pretty girls in LOCNAME. guess she was right, but don't know if any of them will like me. :sigh: I would like a better hair style, mine seems too plane, I would like to spike it like PROPNAME but not as short as most guys nowadays. 00 min. I wonder how much I've written, I should learn to type faster. ice cream. food. hm. I've been eating less lately. pretty much only eating lunch. a late lunch at that, The hills are a live with the sound of music!\" heh, don't know why I just thought of that, 00 min. hm. :looking at finish button: I wonder if I'll be able to print this out. I feel like I'm not thinking deep enough, I wonder why. should I go back this week or no? I want to because my parents probably miss me, and I want to tell them to be less stressed so their immune system won't become worse. there is a potluck party this weekend back home apparently. my roommate is going back, I'm not really thinking any of this I think. it's more like a cover of what my mind is really chaotically thinking about. I don't know, I can't explain it. I can't sleep well. never could. wish I could. then I could stay awake in class. :blank:. well, Merry x'mass for you is on my songs list. it's sung by PROPNAME PROPNAME. wouldn't it be nice to be friends with her, I wonder if I can ever become really important, eh, I think it's more important to know as much as possible and help more people, like superman or something. well, hm. about 00 sec left. I feel like I should type something more meaningful, I've pressed backspace a lot. I wonder how my sister is. I want to go to a party. and meet more people. I wonder how PROPNAME is, he was mad at me, don't know for sure now. PROPNAME is cool, she likes some things that I didn't know anyone else would like, interesting how life works out. didn't know my friend in high school's hobbies would make me interested in something that someone else would be interested in. funny how life is. I've coincidently met people I've not really known but just know on the streets of the campus lately. like Grace and PROPNAME and some other friends. I think I'm getting better at talking. I want to get smarter. I feel small for some reason. dreams are for the lazy. goals are for the ambitious. I like to dream. I'm ambitious. is that bad or good? I have no idea. \nAsnwer:"
