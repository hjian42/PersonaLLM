No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I'm mad because I had just typed for twenty minutes and now I have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. AHHHHHH, I'm mad. Anyways today I turned 00. I'm so happy. Now I'm just going to write about anything because I'm hungry and tired. Today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. I'm mad. Tomorrow I'm going to LOCNAME LOCNAME and I hope me three friends from LOCNAME can come visit me. It'll be all of them, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, my mom, and my two sisters. PROPNAME's letter made me cry. It was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. It was sweet too. PROPNAME made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and I thought he hated me since I'm with PROPNAME and all. That was sweet of him, but I wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. He used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. My other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. Anyways, being 00 will be cool. I finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. I also get to get my own bank account, either ORGNAME ORGNAME or the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME. I also get to go get my driver's license, because I never went to driver's education. Yeah! Okay, I'm a little happy now. PROPNAME is a good boyfriend though. He really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. Like he rather be with me than his friends. That's cool sometimes, but I saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. He hasn't called me yet. Oh oh I'm sad again. I miss him, and I'm glad I get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. I still have homework or should I say dormwork to do. HAHAHAHA! Okay that was corny, but I'm still cool. Oh yeah I'm going to a party at around 0:00. Oh oh I guess I'll have to call PROPNAME by then if he doesn't call me. He said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. I know he had practice today so he got out at 0, but he still hasn't called me. Well it's still light outside, so I guess that's okay. Two more minutes and I hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. Well today was a great day and I feel like PROPNAME PROPNAME typing away at my computer. That was dumb but I'm mad so I guess that's okay. Well times up, bye. \nAsnwer:"
