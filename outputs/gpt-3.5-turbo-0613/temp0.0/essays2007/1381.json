I am wondering if that is a good way to start a stream of consciousness exercise. My computer told me that I misspelled consciousness, but I don't believe it. I have always been a good speller, for years and years and my computer is only a few months old, so what does it know. I lost my geography notes sometime yesterday, so I'm still mad about that since I only found out a little while ago. It makes it tough, especially since the professor said that the class would be split into two parts. The book would cover one set of information, and the lecture would cover another, and I just lost the last two lectures. Oh well. I am thinking that I am thinking too much about what to write, trying not to forget that stream of consciousness is just that. The WP still thinks that I can't spell and I'm becoming irritated because I can't stop writing for twenty minutes to check what the mistake is. I thought someone was in my apartment, but it was just my upstairs neighbors, apparently. It's not any fun having five people and change living right on top of you. I wonder what kind of day it will turn out to be. Hot, probably. I can't wait for the cool weather to come. This oppressive heat makes me not want to go do stuff outside, and I love to do stuff outside. Well, that's not true. It doesn't really make me want to not go outside, it just isn't encouraging. I'm thinking that I've already written a lot for only about 0 minutes. Makes you wonder. I am wishing that I had all the cable channels in my bedroom, since I paid for them. I need a better study ethic. I think that I've been putting in about half the studying that I need to, but I haven't even had any homework or anything to study yet in my math class, so I'm not sure whether I should worry yet. I'm going home this weekend to see my friends and my dad, and I've been thinking about that a lot lately. I feel pressure to stay in contact with people at other school, etc. Maybe after a while, I won't feel that way anymore. I'm sure I won't, just look at my sister. And my brother, they just do their own thing, have their own small groups of friends. I feel I should include my brother. I worry sometimes how I come off, how other people see me. But other times, I couldn't care less how they see me. I think it's justified, I'm not a hypocrite, I just have an idea of myself and how I want to be and be seen and certain things dictate that I make an effort on them, and with other things, if I don't seem to care, then that is how I want to be seen. I realize that my writing is vague, only in ideas and few personal details, but that is what I'm comfortable with. I don't believe in diaries. If I ever did this sort of thing on a regular basis, then I wouldn't ever keep it for someone to find. I would destroy it. Kind of a harsh phrase isn't it. \"Destroy it. \" Like it came from a movie or something. \"Destroy it. \" I'm about to come to the end of my twenty minutes and I think that I've spent too much time correcting typos. Not that I make a lot of typos, but when I do, I always go back and fix them before I go on with my writing. I'm feeling sleepy again and I think I'll go make some coffee. \nAsnwer:"
