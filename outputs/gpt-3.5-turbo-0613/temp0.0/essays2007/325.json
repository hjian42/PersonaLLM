No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I have to work at 0pm, go back to my dorm, and get everything organized I still have to do my geology homework and study that since science is hard for me. I need to go shopping for food also and get my internet connection set up. I hope my dad can help me because if not I don\u2019t know when I will ever get on the net and all my assignments are due over it. I also need to call my PROPNAME in College Station. I don\u2019t know what to do in that situation. I think I love him but I need to date others--but who to date? I am not interested in anyone I only want to know for sure if it is PROPNAME I want but how do I know if he really wants me when we go to such different schools and he will probably find an aggie woman I could find a longhorn man also . the guy I just met is pretty cool but I don't see me dating him maybe I should just have fun and see what happens no need to get serious yet-- unlike PROPNAME and I do not want to be like her and PROPNAME. I am glad I didn\u2019t have to quit my job I love everyone there only my manager is driving me crazy with the shifts I am getting hopefully it will all work out but I have to work 0 shifts today and I still have so much to do I just need to relax or something but I cant until I get all my stuff done. oh well I wish I had time to tell my mom and dad everything that is going on here but things keep coming up people are always calling and or dropping by and there is no time to call unless it is at midnight when they have been asleep for hours its funny because you would think that since we live in the same city I would be able to talk easily but I cant tomorrow is labor day I wonder if PROPNAME will want to do any thing he probably will and I don't know if I have time or not to spend the day with him and if I don\u2019t he will probably throw a fit since he lives in san marcos but he can come home all the time if he wants or I can visit him I wish he wasn\u2019t so needy he has to really we are not together but he has always been like this that is why we could never work out not like brad though he is wonderful but he wrote me some letter I haven\u2019t gotten it yet and he says parts of it are sad and parts happy I wonder is it good sad like he misses me or bad sad like he met someone else I will find out in the next few days  I wonder if PROPNAME got my letter and how he is doing I wonder how mecredy is doing and when he is going back to LOCNAME the PROPNAME strait concert was great I wonder is they got to see brad I wonder how PROPNAME is I haven\u2019t talked to her in a couple of days and we have to do the draw together on Tuesday I hope she can stand in line with me and I may have to leave early since I work at 00:00 I don\u2019t know the games are going to be great I hope I get to go to the A&m game! I don\u2019t think I want to hang out with brad that weekend though I don\u2019t know it depends on him and who knows if I'll get tickets I really want to go though Tyler already has some lined up I wonder how you get to college Station I'm sure someone will give me directions I hope it isn\u2019t too scary I don\u2019t know what I would wear I wonder whose car we could take mine would never make it and it has UT stickers all over so they would trash it \nAsnwer:"
