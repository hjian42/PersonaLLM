No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Towers seemed to have gotten an illness thORGNAME spread very quickly last week. Only difference is everyone felt like crap for a day maybe two, I was sick for four. However, I'm feeling better so perhaps tomorrow is my last day. My mother brought some Echinacea- it's an herb that supposedly helps during the cold and flu season. I pray it does the trick. I am extremely excited about this upcoming weekend. I get to go home- LOCNAME. Isn't that strange? You're supposed to go to college and never want to leave; here I am jumping up and down at the very thought ORGNAME home. Unfortunately, the ORGNAME of ORGNAME at ORGNAME doesn't fit like I thought it would. The university itself is awesome. My professors all seem great and the classes are interesting. The main problem exists at home- University Towers room 000. I typically refuse to stereotype- but I'll make an exception. Most people here are self-absorbed, fake, rich kids. I care more about people and their life experiences. They care more about what you drive or what your father does for a living. Oh well, at least I'm not in this alone. One of my best friends from LOCNAME isn't content here either, except she is at ORGNAME. My roommate, PROPNAME, is really sweet. (I went pot luck). She lived in LOCNAME most her life but her dad got transferred to LOCNAME, so she moved as well. I love hearing stories about the differences. She went to an American school so it's not like she learned Dutch, but still the opportunity was once in a lifetime. My parents moved to LOCNAME LOCNAME LOCNAME, LOCNAME only a month ago. I was able to visit for a week early this summer and sure enough It Was Beautiful. My dad works for ORGNAME ORGNAME and was offered a promotion, salary increase, housing/driver paid, among other things to work in LOCNAME. So they went to check it out and discovered it would be worth it. That's crazy to me. They are 00 years old and completely changing cultures, countries, etc. In a way I'm thrilled for them. Yet, my sadness that they're 00 hours away overcomes that. It's not all a sad story though. I have a gorgeous place to visit for Christmas vacation (there it will be spring I think) and my parents and I are going through life changes at the same time. Also, my house will still be there; my oldest brother and his wife are moving in. So I have my oh, so comfortable bed to retreat to at Thanksgiving. This is strange to me. a writing assignment that doesn't require revising and outline and spell check. Actually I like it more because I feel like I'm talking to someone. I'd much rather talk than write. English is my least favorite/worst subject. I do well in math but I don't like it. History is okay, depending if the teacher makes it exciting. Science is the best. if I weren't so crazy about dance and teaching I'd become a chemical engineer. But I believe I'd get bored of that job real quick. Well, times up. I'll sign off and go study. \nAsnwer:"
