My teammates and I have very little coordination amongst ourselves, we always just end up doing things individually instead of as a team. PROPNAME usually ends up spamming huntresses by himself in a corner, PROPNAME makes a few footman and then techs to knights, which usually then get killed, and I try to scout or tech myself. Their is no over-arching strategy to our game, which is the problem. In a one-on-one game, I only have to be concerned with what I am doing and making, and only what my single enemy is doing or making. I have decided to dub the name of our team   Team Suck  , because we are that terrible. Oh well, I can still tower rush the newbs on battle. net any day.      Amazingly enough, I don't have a lot of work to do tonight, aside from this assignment I'm doing right now so that I can go ahead and have it out of the way. Hopefully, I won't have any work to do this weekend when the fam comes to visit. And even if I do, I will just do as much as I can on Sunday night instead of burdening myself with it while they are here. It's not that I don't have a work ethic, it's just that I prioritize doing things with them above reading out of a textbook, which I will be doing all the time while I am here at LOCNAME. They are only going to be around for a few days, and then I may not see them again until the next break.     I wonder when it will start getting cold around here, I brought my jacket, but I shouldn't need it until October or so I believe. My bathroom is quite the feces-infested cesspool right now, I should probably do something about that. It's beginning to get kind of nauseating, but perhaps if I can out-last the guy next door, he will do it before I do. Pretty sick, I know, but I did it when I first got here and I'll be damned if I get to do it every time. I should also vacuum the room, that is getting pretty disgusting as well. Crumbs and such will attract all kinds of vermin eventually. I wonder how often (if ever) they spray for bugs around here. A couple of times I've gone into the bathroom and found one in the tub or on the floor. One time I actually stepped on one before I knew what it was in the dark. That was quite nasty.     There Zendt goes, IMing me while I'm doing my writing assignment. must not answer it. must continue my non-sequitious train of thought. i wonder if I spelled non-sequitious correctly. If i spent a few seconds checking it on dictionary. com it shouldn't cut into my writing. aw screw it, who cares if the prof or LOCNAME or whoever reads this thinks im an illiterate boob. I don't think they are checking on spelling anyway. I bet there are other stream of consciousness writings by students who have trouble writing in english because they are from other countries, so why should I care if i have a few typos. I could pretend I'm a foreigner from LOCNAME or some crap, even if it did matter. Except now I've written it in here, so they would have incriminating evidence. Wow, this is too much digression into an idiotic train of thought. Must think of something else to type about. . . . . .     Um, i think I'm losing my focus a little now. man, my nails are dirty, look at that. That charcoal I've been using is a damn mess. I hope that we don't do too many more charcoal drawings now. Those blind contour drawings are so much cleaner.  I wonder if they will egver get more cups in the kitchen. I am getting pretty effin' sick of bringing my own cup to dinner. that is pure bovine-cacka. I wonder if they care about me typing cuss words in here. better not do it just to be on the safe side. Must try to maintain some false sense of professionalism. time. is. almost. . . up. . . . . NOW \nAsnwer:"
