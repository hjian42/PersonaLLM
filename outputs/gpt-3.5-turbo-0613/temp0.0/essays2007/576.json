No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Mom shpuldn't worry about me not being htere to answer the phone-I just missed her is the funny part. I wonder if dad misses me as much as Crystal dad does her. Care bear watch. That was interesting activity in theatre class-I loved that girl's folder from LOCNAME. I wonder if that director thinks I totally butchered PROPNAME. My monolague who cares. Why does PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME's sucha  tomboy-adn I'm not saying that because I think he's cute too, but because she is-but that'sn mena she's really sweet also. Sort of. I need to study for this biology class. I've got to get ahead on my reading. Psychology is so differetn from the way0 my mind works-I'm a math and science person. I think with  numbers and diagrams. Crystal wants to be a psychology major-that noise is bugging me it sounds like a cd player  being loaded and unloaded. That guy I talked to the other day is such a hottie. Floor 00 I think-I might just have to get lost up there. Got I need to read!!!Luke is so cute for writing me-why is it my ex can't say more than three words to me but his best friend can send letters and everything. Math class in a bit-my teacher is so bizarre. Really quirky- but just not all there. WHat is this complex that I have with people in a authority-I mean why just because they are over me do I find them attractive-it's so weird. I can't wait to see PROPNAME PROPNAME next weekend. watch him be out of town or gone. That was a mistake. But, it was bound to happen. Why have I not really gotten homesick? is there something wrong with  me?Everyone I know has had some brush with  this , but I'm still fine-and, I lloove my family and there just wonderful. I need to call the Greek life board, the coppertank, and get that ink for my computer, let's see. can't call to this weekend with  the phone and trent has no wayt of hearing from me. IK wonder if a lot of people are going outb of town for labor day weekend? last year we went camping I was with  PROPNAME then--he was a sweetie, but the breath thing got in the way. Is that shallow of me-I can't wait to see the people who were cast for this play? It's so highgly competitive. But there's sucha  rewarding feeling when you step out of that room knowing good and well that you produced something from your imagination and hard work and effort. I wonder if this is enough. HOw would they know if I stopped at 00 or 00 minutes-BUT I WON\"T STOP UNTIL 00 MINUTES HAS ELASPED!!=) I'm starting to get hungry and some how I need to trek to rlm from here-I need to find the cam pus loop schedule. It's so quiet in this library I love it. This is the only place I can really study everyone is loud on our floor do they ever study or did they sign up for some course I don't know about. I'm so proud of myself I haven't gone out at all this week. Does PROPNAME really like PROPNAME if he sayus he loves her that's such crap. Oh well time up, bye. \nAsnwer:"
