No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: class lasted all day today. on Tuesdays and Thursdays I have class from 0-0, 0 is to early 0 is to late. I like earlier classes its easy to concentrate in the mornings. I worked out today  I think I hurt my elbow there is alot of pain in the  joint. I have been lifting weights for a long time maybe that has something to do with it. lost 0 pounds today, I now way 000 lbs. my mother thinks I grew another inch I don\u2019t know maybe. this typing is really bothering my elbow, damm thing really  hurts. I think I am going to take some aspirin. I've got a biology test in two weeks, lots of studying to do. first test should not be so bad just a review of chemistry. the class moves pretty fast but the  professor is pretty good. the seats in that class are way to close together. I am about 0-0 maybe a little more and my knees push right up against the backs of the chairs. it makes it hard to concentrate after about 00 min. all my other classes the chairs are pretty comfortable. I hope we beat ORGNAME on sat. I hope the d defense can hold PROPNAME PROPNAME under 000 yards. PROPNAME PROPNAME might not play, but PROPNAME is a good back up. PROPNAME will have a great day and will kick ass. \nAsnwer:"
