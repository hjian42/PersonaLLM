Everything toward school work right now is going easy but all my feelings for my friends and my boyfriend are burning inside of me. I feel as if my classes are going to turn right around on me and kick me  in the butt. I don't know if I should stress out about them or later. PROPNAME is  starting to act like a jerk. I hope he hasn't found someone else. I broke up  with him last night because of the way he has been treating me. I regret it but  I feel as if I did the right thing. I am so confused! Eventually I will get back with him. Boy do I miss him. My legs are very sore from lifting weights yesterday I hope that my legs get in shape. I really want to lose weight. I feel very fat sometimes. Well my cousin PROPNAME is coming down from the ORGNAME this weekend. Should I go home to see him or stay here?  I know if I go home I will probably call PROPNAME  and we will probably call PROPNAME and we will get back. I guess my cousin going  home can be an excuse for me to go down and talk to PROPNAME. Another reason to go down home is for PROPNAME's license plates. Again that is another excuse. Lately PROPNAME has been on the phone all the time making me mad because I want to use the phone also. G-whiz my legs are hurting. I really need to find a job here around campus. I want to work in the library but hopefully there won't be any hassles. PROPNAME my neighbor is crazy. Him and his  girlfriend are really cute together. Why can't PROPNAME and I be like them. Both PROPNAME and PROPNAME love to work out. Whenever I go I go with them. Well actually I have been  going everyday with them. I need money!! This show that is on is weird. I have listening  to it while I am writing. It is making me sad. Well I better go my time is up.      \nAsnwer:"
