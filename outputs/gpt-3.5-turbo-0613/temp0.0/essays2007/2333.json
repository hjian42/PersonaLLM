I HAVE BEEN AT HOME DURING THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. I MISSED MY FAMILY SO MUCH ESPECIALLY MY DOG MENO. I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW. I HAVE TODAY OFF. MY CLASS IS NOT UNTIL 0:00 PM AND THE CLASS IS BIO 000.      MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR IS PRETTY FUNNY EVENTHOUGH I ONLY UNDERSTAND HIM HALF OF THE TIME. THE FUNNY THING IS HE LECTURES BETTER THAN MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR. MY BIO 000 PROFESSOR REALLY CANNOT LECTURE AT ALL. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH. I REALLY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND HIM OR ELSE MY EXAMS WILL BE EXTREMELY HORRIBLE. I HAVE A HUGE HEADACHE RIGHT NOW.      I'M WATCHING SOAPS RIGHT NOW. I'M WAITING TO WATCH ALL MY CHILDREN. RIGHT NOW I'M WATCHING PORT CHARLES WHICH BROKE OFF OF GENERAL HOSPITAL. RIGHT NOW PROPNAME IS LOCKED IN JAIL. EVERYONE THINKS SHE KILLED HER BEST FRIEND FATHER BUT IN REALITY SHE REALLY DIDN'T. PROPNAME IS A PERSON THAT IS SWEET AND INNOCENT AND CAN NEVER KILL ANYONE. THE PERSON THAT REALLY KILLED OR HURT ALISON'S BEST FRIEND PROPNAME IS A WOMAN THAT DIED 000 YEARS AGO. SHE HAS BLACK MAGIC. SHE CAME OUT OF THE PICTURE. IT IS REALLY FUNNY. KNOW WONDER THIS SHOW WAS CUT OFF OF ORGNAME. IT'S ABOUT MAGIC AND VAMPIRES.      WOW I CAN'T BELIEVER I HAVE ONLY BEEN WRITING FOR 0 MINUTES. 00 MINUTES FEEL SO FAR AWAY. I JUST SIGNED UP FOR THE PRESCREENING SURVEY. I WONDER HOW THAT WORKS.       YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GONE SHOPPING IN A LONG TIME. I MISS IT. THE MALL DOWN HERE REALLY SMELLS AND IS PRETTY OLD BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE STORES I LIKE. LIKE ORGNAME, ORGNAME SPORT, ORGNAME ORGNAME AND BLACK MARKET, ORGNAME. I MISS MY GALLERIA IN DALLAS. I USUALLY GO SHOPPING ONCE A WEEK BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN A MONTH SINCE I HAVE GONE.       I CAN'T BELIEVE MY BROTHER IS STILL SLEEPING IT IS LIKE ALMOST 00 IN THE AFTERNOON.       SPEAKING OF MY BROTHER. HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF OF COURSE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE CAREER LAST NIGHT. I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF PHARMACY IS REALLY THE WAY I WANT TO GO. I LIKE IT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THAT LONG AND IT MAKES GOOD MONEY, BUT I DON'T KOW IF I REALLY AM GOING TO ENJOY IT. I WISH I COULD FIND SOMETHING IN UT THAT WOULD POP OUT AT ME. I WANT A CAREER THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY AND MAKE GOOD MONEY. I WISH I HAD A DREAM THAT WOULD TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT I WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE. I WISH GOD WOULD COME INTO MY DREAM AND TELL ME THAT THIS IS THE PATH YOU ARE TAKING TO THE FUTURE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE TO KNOW. I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH TO MY FUTURE. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE HALF OF MY LIFE ON SOMETHING I WILL HATE IN THE FUTURE. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING WILL TRIGGER ME SOON.        I AM STILL WATCHING SOAPS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES ALL MY CHILDREN WILL BE ON. WOW I ONLY HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT TO WRITE. I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD SO MUCH TO SAY. IT REALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER JUST TO SAY EVERYTHING ON MY MIND. \nAsnwer:"
