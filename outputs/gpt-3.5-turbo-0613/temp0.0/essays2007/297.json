No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I don't really know how to start this but I guess it really doesn\u2019t matter Computers are so frustrating. I wish I knew more about them. Its 0:00 now so I need to write until hmmmm 0:00. That\u2019s not to bad. I wonder what that guy keeps laughing about, It must be some really fun assignment or maybe he\u2019s on email with some girl or something. He pretty cute, kind of looks like the guy on  The Princess Bride. I love that movie , haven\u2019t seen it in a while. This assignment is kind of hard because I cant type as fast as I think. Oh, this is how this thing works. Kind of annoying You cant even see what your writing! How dumb. I wonder what PROPNAME is writing I hope my email got to PROPNAME and PROPNAME. That would stink if it didn\u2019t. What time is it anyway?  0:00 00 more minutes. There sure is alot of people here for a Friday afternoon. I wonder if I'll be  in here alot doing homework. Probably. I'm kind of tired. I hope gosh I'm hungry. I hope that HOPE is fun tonight. I want to meet some people . I hope PROPNAME comes I wonder if PROPNAME or PROPNAME called. I bet PROPNAME did for sure. I wish he was more  talkative but he's really nice. I bet PROPNAME kind of likes PROPNAME. I wonder if  I'm going to be able to get out of this computer without having to have that  weird guy help me again. I felt so dumb. I need to do my research requirement  soon so I don\u2019t get behind. There's a lot I need to do. That guy is laughing again. I kind of wish I could just laugh back at him. Gosh I'm a really slow typer. I hope I'm doing this right. I wish all my assignments were this easy. I need a floppy disk and oh yeah I need to get those Paradigm notes for Zoology. I bet PROPNAME doesn\u2019t remember to bring me hers. Oh well. She's really nice. I wonder where that girl is from. She has a funny accent. I think I've written for about 00 minutes  now so I guess I'll quit even though I don\u2019t have very much typed out . I'm just slow. Besides they didn\u2019t say this had   to be a certain length just a 00 min. time frame. I wonder what\u2019s for dinner tonight. I think I'll go find out. \nAsnwer:"
