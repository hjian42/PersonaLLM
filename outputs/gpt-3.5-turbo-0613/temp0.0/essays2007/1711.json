My thoughts are actually really scattered right now, but this is due tomorrow, so, here it goes. I guess what's really on my mind is this PROPNAMEy and this week. It's been really, really stressful. The only thing more stressful than having a lot of stress in you life is the people you love having a lot of stress in their lives too. The week did not start off well, as I lost a really cushy job, and it was just because I procrastanated and that made if even worse. Then, I got an interview, off campus 00 min of course, that was probably going to suck anyway, and I had all kinds of problems trying to print out resumes and work study verification forms because one computer had a printer and one had the internet and of course neither one would work with both, so I was frantically trying to get them to work and had no time for rest or lunch, didn't know where I was supposed to go and was freaking out. I could have cried. Right before I was about to walk out for my interview though, on chance I called back a lady that I had left a message for about a really cool job having to do with my major at an art museum on campus. It  was my dream job but I was sure it would already be gone. Just my luck though, I impressed the woman enough she hired me on the spot and I got the job!  It was really cool, but the stress leading up to it sucked. So things got better after that but today things were just shit. One of my friends is having all kinds of family problems because her father was being a selfish jerk. My other best friend's grandmother died and needless to say he was very upset. I cooked dinner for them though, but there is still so much drama around me and I hate drama. I guess I can't complain though, my job is great. I love working with art. The lady I'm working with takes time to tell me about everything. There were just a lot of jobs cut though and I feel really bad for her because I know she has a lot of stress because a lot of her help just got fired. But my other co-worker is really funny and I like her a lot but I'm really sad that she might be going away soon to LOCNAME, D. C. Everyone  else seems really awesome though and it's really laid back and flexible. Let's see what else. Oh yeah, of course boy troubles. Boys suck, that's all there is to it. Sometimes, I wish they would all just die. Or at least those that suck. Not my friend da PROPNAME though. I love him. He e-mailed me another of his famous funny e-mails and it always makes me feel better. :)  Also people who criticize you for stuff that's none of their business. Know what I really need?  A break from all people. I just want to be alone. I want to jump on a plane and go some place thousands of miles away with a different culture and everything. I want to go to a dig in LOCNAME and get away from everything. I hate feeling I owe something to other's feelings. I guess I'm just tired. The minute you get caught up in others lives you invite so much drama and pain into your life. I guess I'm just tired of that. It would just be great to start all over again, but I know that I can't regret the past and that I learn from everything I do. I have to keep reminding myself that my life is really not that bad after all, I mean I have awesome classes, great oppurtunities, a man that really does love me, and friends who really do mean the best even if I do want to choke them or run away from them sometime. In the end, I guess it's worth it because I know how lonely and boring life would be with out all of them there. It's just what you have to put up with. I only wish judgement from those you love was not so harsh or deep reaching. Well, I'm about out of time (thankfully my shoulder is hurting) so this is my great rant, but I'm done now and writing all out really does make you feel better. :) \nAsnwer:"
