Currently I'm ecstatic because I just found out that my soccer team may be going to ORGNAME ORGNAME and that is where my best friend, PROPNAME PROPNAME is going to school. I miss her SO much! When I think of her I never have any bitterness or resentment in my heart, but rather gratitude that God brought her into my life. With my constantly shifting moods and feelings, she was always a pillar of strength and stability, the most loyal friend I have ever had. I had so much trust in her, that many times I found myself dependent on her when I needed a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on. I remember a time when I was at my other best friends house and we had a discouraging talk about how I felt her boyfriend was consuming her life. Immediately after I left I drove two blocks to PROPNAME's house and there she was ready to listen and pray with me. People say that the deep friendships are formed in college, but I know that the friendship PROPNAME and I have can't get much more intimate than ours. Through out high school we ran cross country and had classes together, therefore we knew every event happening in each other's lives. That's why it's so hard not having her here with me to share the experience of college with. Although I miss her dearly, self pity will not consume me because I am confident that God has prosperous plans for me at LOCNAME and PROPNAME at LOCNAME. Also this will each me to become completely dependent on PROPNAMEt and His promises and not on fleeting things of this world. I really hope that I will not become hardened by the sin that is in me and surrounds me daily. Already I find myself not making time to be in the Word, which is the armor I need to remain strong against the enemy. I can relate with PROPNAME who can't understand why he does the very things he despises. But glory be to God who makes me free of guilt through PROPNAME. Why He chose me, I have no idea. My mind can only take so much of seriousness, then it wanders back to funny Chris PROPNAME lines or petty worries of the day. Already I am thinking of other assignments I need to complete after this and of how I need to get in touch with certain people. Yet we are suppose to live our lives a prayer to God, and I have such trouble letting Christ shine out of me when I am running errands, or standing in lines, or in class. Lord, please make me a bondservant to serve You daily on this campus or where ever I am and who ever I run into. \nAsnwer:"
