And here I was thinking that this class would be fun and exciting and relaxing, EXCLUDING any sort of writing assignment like the history or english classes. Man I am making so many mistakes as I type, I couldn't possibly be nervous I know that for sure. Oh look, what do you know, only about 0 minute and 00 seconds have gone by; I really don't know if I can keep this up for another 00 minutes or so. I wonder if grammar actually counts, not like I would receive any points on it if I wrote it any slower with a timer right on top of me anyway. Hmm. think I will go back and read this message before I continue any longer. But, I guess that would kind of defy the purpose of writing in a stream of consciousness manner. Stream of consciousness, that term reminds me of my humanities class in 0th and 00th grade. It definitely reminds of PROPNAME PROPNAME, the author of Ulysses who attempted to write an ENTIRE BOOK based on the method of stream of consciousness. Man that was quite painful to read, since he didn't use ANY SORT OF PUNCTUATIONS AT ALL. Maybe I'm not supposed to be using any punctuations either. I wonder if I'm destroying the purpose of this experiment. Writing this makes me wonder, can this REALLY be stream of consciousness? There had to have been some premeditation involved one point of another. I'm beginning to feel like my thoughts are premeditated as well. Heck, whatever gets me the credit and grades for this class. Dr. PROPNAME is one hilarious person, good at making fun of people. There is nothing better than public humiliation of individuals who like to stand out among his or her classmates. It is always a good laugh. Well, Friday's almost here, that means another week of my completely wasted college life has gone by. At least I get to go home for this weekend, I'm really sick of consuming the heinously disgusting American food at the Jester buffet or city limits. I'm actually going home for business training. Since I am an independent business owner, I should probably learn some management skills and as well as how to expand all the assets that I have. Speaking of assets, I just recently learned the importance of being able to distinguish between what exactly is an asset and a liability. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a very, very intelligent man. I guess why he's the multi-millioinaire and I'm not. Oh well, maybe I'll get to his place someday with the help of my friend. Weird, what was I thinking. I could've sworn I was talkin about goin back home for business training earlier. I guess this is what stream of consciousness is all about huh. Man, it seems like it's been forever, but only 00 minutes has gone by. Speaking of time, it reminds me of the different theories that people have developed over their life time. Some people thinks the time goes by faster if they stare at the clock. Personally, I think the clock goes by so much quicker if I'm not constantly staring at it all the time. I wonder how many spelling mistakes I've failed to correct in this writing assignment, oh well. Back to the business training, I hope the ninety dollars were well spent. I really hope that BWW has put together somethin good this year, something that all the BWW/QUIXTAR-Affiliated Independent Business Owner can benefit from. Man that was a pain to type, I probably should've just typed BWW/QUIXTAR IBO's for that matter. Anyways, most of my friends don't seem to believe in the business that I'm participating in, well actually, owning. I don't really get any respect from them at all, and sometimes I really wonder why that is. The only thing I'm waiting to do now is being able to handle my business correctly, expand it large enough so I'll have multi-million dollar returns. And then I think I'm going to come back and laugh at all of the people that has disparaged the activity I was involved in. Even better, the stupid electrical engineers that I call friends can work for me in the future. Just as PROPNAME PROPNAME says,   an intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are to work for them.  I will be able to prove myself one day. Being able to beat them down is probably the only drive or motivation that exists in my life. Besides PROPNAME of course, she is the love of my life. Without her, I don't think I would've sanely passed through the toughest times of my life. I'm really hoping to get married to her one day, and make her the happiest woman on the face of this planet by providing her with everything that I possibly can. Looks like I better get rich quick. But, I doubt she's interested in me being rich, I truly believe that she's with me today because it was her choice. She's not the type of person that would regret any decisions she has made in the field of love and relationships, which is something I really respect. She always gives her all, always tries to put on a smile just for me even though she may be having the worst day of her life. I'm so lucky that I've found her, and I'm willing to treasure this relationship for the rest of my life. I cannot really express my love for her in words, nor in sentences, maybe not even an essay of this length. All I can pray for is that someday, she will be able to touch my heart with her hands and fully understands the kind of appreciation that resides within the innermost side of my heart. I thank God everyday for all the things He has bestowed upon me. Of course, besides eternal life, Daisy is the next greatest gift that I have ever received. Oh look, time's up, bye! \nAsnwer:"
