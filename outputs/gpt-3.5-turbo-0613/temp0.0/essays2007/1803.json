No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      my roommate is gone once again. to class i believe. he's a strange sucker it   really befuddles me how he denies having whey protein and instantly changes the   subject. i wish my hands weren't so swollen it might make this easier. speaking   of psycology the professors lecture today was interesting to say the least,   especially finding out that scientists sit around shocking rats to make the ejaculate   and pass out, very strange. also strange is how someone whom i thought was   one of my most hated enemies or deemed me as such is sitting next to me in that   class . and how the girl that sat next to me comes off as much more a    city   person   than she really is.      my floor is really strange, they all just sneak around, the first week i only saw one   other person that lived up here other than my roommate who is strange himself as   previously noted, i feel compelled to change my major to pys so i can deconstruct   him and make him paranoid of the world, mostly cause of the whey protein   incident. grrr and he plays video games non fucking stop it's driving me insane,   and he's s junior. i t hought he was s freshman the way his mother was helping   move him in and such, my folks didn't even help me pack back at home, they said     see ya next weekend     we're coming down for the game'    i do'nt want to do my economics homework, so i'm doing this instead as a more   viable excuse than just sitting in front of the computer chatting and checking the   weather. leastwise i'm getting something done cause i won't be here thursday or   friday on account of me going to  a horse show in springfield ill. where i'll be   competing for 0 national championships and as i think in contention for both, so it   could potentially be a very good weekend. i'm also excited about seeing some   girl friends i haven't seen in a yr and i'm hoping they are equally excited, but we'll   see. and i hope our trainer doesn't mess the horse up before i show considering   i'll have zero practice because i show right after i fly in    speaking of flying i hope that planes will be in the air and a similar thing to last   year won't happen. we had to drive 00 hours as opposed to flying since all flights   were cancelled for an indetermined amount of time. and the show's bad timing of   starting on the 00th. and of course it's the same this yr too    i hate it when my brother's girlfriend tries to talk to me and i hate it when people   ask what i'm doing, if i'm on the computer i'm on the computer i'm not doing   anything elsewise i'd be out doing it. man coke is good, the beverage of course.   so much better than pepsi and r. c. and that ripp of stuff you get at supermarkets   that have stupid names. i hate pigeons  they really bother me   the seem so unclean  especially when you are swimmin in the pool and they are drinking and bathing in   the other side  i hate that  and those grackels they just look dirty and so annoying  but the squirrels are cool i've been tempted many a time to just grab one  but i think that wouldn't be wise especially since i don't plan on visiting the health   center any time soon, so i refrain, but it would be cool  especially to see all the out-there animal rights and weirdos faces, those people   drive me insane and all the christian rhetoric don't they have something better to   do than harrass me when i'm walking early in the morning or if i'm carrying   something the bastards set it on top, ggrrrrrr, very aggrivating, and the newspaper   what up with that if we want one we'll grab it ourselves, they'd probably get rid of   more that way because the second you call out to someone they instantly take a   defensive posture even if it is free. it's this damn culture of telemarketers and   wackos, you're constantly berrated to buy something or not buy something on   grounds that somebody else or something else will benefit, without regard to the   purchaser, but one day i hope to exploit that just like the other guy because with   the right mind set and marketing ploy people will buy anything you tell them to and   that my friend has been proved over and over again. . \nAsnwer:"
