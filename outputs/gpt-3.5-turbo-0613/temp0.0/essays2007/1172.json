Will Professor PROPNAME use this writing assignment as some kind of test? Interesting approach! Oh. wow. I have Psychology this Monday. I wonder what we're going to cover. I still have to read chapter two. Too much homework and so little time! I wonder when mom's going to get home. Is she going to the grocery store again? I have to ask PROPNAME about this. I really want some gum. I really wish that mom would get me some. Oh. this cricket is really annoying. Stop making that sound please! Is it already the cricket season again? Last year, I've seen about a hundred crickets, some dead and some alive, in front of ORGNAME. Now, we have crickets outside of my bedroom window. Great! Wow. PROPNAME has been watching the TV for a long time now. I'll give her fifteen more minutes and then I'm going to go turn off the TV. She should read more. Oh. I have to read my Biology too. I don't exactly want to read it. It's not going to be fun. I really want to go do something exciting so I can kind of clear my head up a little bit. I can probably ask dad to take me to the lake tomorrow. We can probably bring some food and have a picnic there. I really hope dad doesn't already have a plan. I have to ask dad, right away, when he gets home. Anyway, I have to start thinking about my schoolwork. I wonder how people can make perfect 0. 0 gpas. The must be really smart. I should study harder. I need to have better study skills. Oh. this Monday I need to go meet my Biology teacher. She's a really good teacher. I need to tell her that. This woman can really explain stuff. I should go look for the red folder and check for her office hours. I wish her office hour were somewhere from twelve o'clock to two o'clock. Ah. the crickets. the noise. this is really annoying. If this keeps on going, how am I supposed to sleep tonight? I really need lots of sleep. I'm really tired today. Wow. I can't believe I actually vacuumed the whole house today. I never thought I could have done this for just one morning. Amazing! I really want mom to get home soon. I wonder what we're going to have for dinner tonight. I really want chicken noodle soup. I also want some salads. Please get home soon. I'm hungry. Oh. thirty more seconds then I'm done with this writing assignment. If Professor PROPNAME read this he'll probably think that I don't have a stable mind. Ah. time's up. \nAsnwer:"
