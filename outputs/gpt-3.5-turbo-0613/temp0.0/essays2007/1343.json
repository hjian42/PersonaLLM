So I think that I will write about what I know the most about. I know the most about myself. Maybe this means I'm stuck up  because I'm writing about myself and not about something important, like homelessness or starvation and poverty and other things of that nature. But if that is the case, I will just have to be stuck up. I don't know that I really understand myself, so I'm not really sure what I should say. Sometimes, I'm fairly predictable. Other times, I just don't know why I do what I do. I guess everyone could say that about themselves, so I'm not being too original here. I'll try to think of something more original. I am weird. I wonder if everyone thinks that they are weird. I am not comfortable with love, yet I crave it. I close the door in love's face when it comes knocking. I like movie love. The kind where everything just ends happily ever after. PROPNAME is a perfect example. She finds the man of every woman's dreams, and gets him. I think I once found the man of my dreams. But I just wasn't ready to find him then. At least that will be my excuse for letting him get away. I wonder why people think that love is so important to find. I feel like it is the purpose of our being here. Do animals really search for the ONE? Or do they just find a new partner every season? Maybe that is what is supposed to set humans aside from animals. Everyone thinks that humans are so much smarter than animals. I think that maybe animals are much smarter. They don't mess with love. They just have mates. I bet their lives are less stressful. I guess love really isn't that stressful, as long as both people are in love. It seems to me that when you are in love, everything seems perfect. Life suddenly loses its stressfulness. I think the phrase is that it looks like you're looking at the world through rosetinted glass. Roses are nice. I love flowers in general. They smell good. They look pretty. They are such pointless gifts because they die so quickly once they are cut. But I guess that is what makes them so nice to receive  the simple fact that someone spent money on something that will only last a few days just to brighten your face for a moment. \nAsnwer:"
