No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: It seems a bit strange just to be writing to be writing but I am it is probably very interesting to read back over it after you are done writing it. I am so used to being in English classes were you have to keep thinking about what you are writing that it seems strange to me right now that I am just writing thoughts as they are coming out of my mind with no real point are concern of where this is going. I have done an assignment like this for a writing course before but its purpose was to help us learn to let our thoughts flow more vividly on the paper so I am a bit curious about what this could tell about myself. I honestly hate computers and typing so I can't say I am enjoying myself too much right now. The clock seems to always move very slow when you are doing something just to do it for a timed amount of time. I suppose I will just keep rambling on though to get to that twenty minutes. I really did wait until almost the last possible second to do this today. Its around four right now so I will be sending this in just minutes before it is supposed to be turned in. This week has really drained me and I am so glad it is friday. I can actually get some sleep now and go out and unwind and have some fun. I really wanted to cut back on the partying this year but so far I'm not off to a good start at least I'm not going out every night though. I have a job now though so I suppose that occupies a good part of my time. Its a pain trying to balance that and school but at least this gives me money to go out now and have a good time. I'm a little more self dependent then I was last year. I'm not having to call home all the time and ask for money. I just have a couple more minutes so I am trying to think of something to say right now. My mind just feels like mush. My whole body needs sleep and rest but I am going to just go out and wear it out anyway. I'm young I should have fun while I still can. That is exactly what I am going to do now because I have reached my little time limit so I hope you have had a great time reading my ramblings from my little mind. \nAsnwer:"
