No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: that's  a typical girl response I guess I still have about fifteen minutes left I tried right before this to take the pretest again. the first time I only got as far as the 00th question and it wouldn't let me continue now it says the line is busy or something like that I don't mind volunteering for experiments and I understand that experimenting is essential for the psychology students but I think that it is wrong for the department to force us to do this or they will block our grade and I have already been to mezes twice to try to sign up and there was no space left and the only space left was for males only so it's just a little frustrating I'm trying to think I don't type very well because it has been so long since I had to type anything I can't remember when I wrote an essay last my high school was a joke we only had 0 classes at a time for an hour and a half per class every day and we had finals four times a year although I usually exempted them you don't know how glad I am to be out of high school I really didn't like it there too much that might have something to do with the fact that we had 0000 students on one campus I really enjoy attending ut although I don't have a major yet everyone says that's okay but I would really like to get onto taking courses that specifically interest me I'm thinking about majoring in government with a minor in german but I might go into political science it's whatever I've so many ideas of what \"I want to be when I grow up\" that even includes psychology like everybody and their mom wants to do. I have about five minutes left I'm still hungry and after this I'm going to try to take the pretest again. yesterday I moved from the 00th floor of jester west to the 0th floor my roommate never showed up and this girl PROPNAME's roommate also never showed up so I moved into her room she's really nice and this is so weird: we are so alike she even has my birthday she lives in LOCNAME city which is right outside LOCNAME where I live pretty nifty huh so we're going to go shopping and decorate our room some more it's going to look really cool I'm still hungry and I really don't want to eat that nasty jester food but I might as well because I already paid for it well not really the bill comes later this month anyway my 00 minutes is up and I'll be back here tomorrow to do assignment number two \nAsnwer:"
