No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: You know I always wonder if I'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. I had opportunities to go to other universities but I chose to stay close to home. My parents always want it there way! They basically chose my major for me and when I wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. I want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and I know I'm going to stress over it, why should I bother to listen and I went with what I felt was best for me and I made the change. I always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. I see people trying so hard to make that A in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. One thing which confuses me is how girls think. They're like in their own world sometimes. You try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest IDIOT! I wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. They should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. Why do the ORGNAME suck so bad this year? They had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. They were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. They're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the ORGNAME. I mean if you had PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? The rockets need to do better next year also. I can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. They could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. If they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. I don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. It would be so much easier to study the material but NO, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. One thing I really love in the ORGNAME are the girls. They are so damn hot! Only if I could have one of them would I show them what kind of man I really am! Its ok, one day, I will find the right one. \nAsnwer:"
