No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well, I am sitting in the library right now, you know the one across from  LOCNAME LOCNAME. I am hard at work trying to think of things and writing  them down as I go along. Oh, I just heard someone moving in  his seat making  a creaking noise. There he goes again. Why can\u2019t he this guy sit still. Boy am I sleepy, my neck has a cramp and there goes that guy again moving in  his in his seat. Oh, the fountain (I had to look up for this one) is making  noise. Okay. it stopped now. Boy am I tired. I wish I was sleeping right now. I can hear people walking in the distance and someone flipping through pages  in a book. I wonder what he is looking for. It is probably something for his  ultra tough class. Man, I am tired. Excuse me but I have to stop writing for  a second. Boy I really can not see anything without my glasses. My eyesight  must be really bad. Go figure, I have been wearing glasses since the 0th grade. I liked them at first and thought they were cool but I despise wearing glasses. It hurts my ears and gives me a headache  sometimes. Ah, just needed to pull  the chair in a little. Man, I wish someone was here to massage my neck and  shoulder, preferably a girl. This just can not get any worse, now I am  beginning to feel pain in my forearm from writing so much. I think I am really  out of shape for my forearm to be hurting so much. Wow, this is truly horrific,  everything around me is a blur. Man, if someone killed every one in this room  and I saw him. I would probably not be able to identify him or even describe  him to the police. Boy, my sight is so bad. Good, I only have about eight more  minutes of writing. I wish I can go to sleep right now, but no, I have to  finish this writing assignment. Man, does this mean I would have to type this  on the computer. Great, well I will be getting out of here real soon. Oh, I can  see much better now. What is with the neck cramp. Things could not get any  worse for me. Here I am sitting here and having to write for at least twenty  minutes on the stream of my conscience. My eyes are drooping and heavy, my  chest is in pain from the way I am sitting, and my right arm is so tired. Please stop! Dude, I have about three more minutes. Time sure flies by real  fast. Yeah right! Cool, that guy has an outline of a roadrunner on the back of  his shirt. Man, well is he not a little too noisy. I mean we are in the library,  man, and people are trying to do a writing assignment for psychology here, man. Dude, I just heard the door opened and shut. Alright, I can finally stop now. Hope you like it. That was twenty minutes of my life down the tube. Thanks a  lot. Just kidding. Ha! Ha! \nAsnwer:"
