Makes me feel kind of uncomfortable I guess, I don't know why though. But my stomach kind of hurts right now, my roommate and I just had some ice cream, so maybe that's why. I'm kind of stressed right now, and I hope I get everything I need to get done done tonight. I'm really tired and I just want to go to bed. I'm really hot in my dorm, maybe I should turn the fan on, but I'm too lazy to get up and do that right now. So I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing right now. I talked to him a few minutes ago and he was doing homework. I wonder what homework he has?  Man, I'm really not looking forward to tomorrow. I have so much stuff to do, at least that's what I feel like. And I really want to go to TOPS to look at the pictures. Hopefully PROPNAME will go with me tomorrow and do that. My foot is really itching me, I think I got bit by a bug tonight at the ZETA house. I was outside doing my homework which was probably not a good idea, but oh well. Oh I need to call my parents too. I wonder if they're having a good time in LOCNAME. I wish I was there right now. I miss them already, but I'm only three hours away so it's okay. I'll be fine. I really want to go running outside on the track tonight. It felt so good out earlier and I bet that would help with my feeling stressed out. But I probably won't because I'm so tired and my stomach still hurts. I wonder what's wrong with it. Twenty minutes is a long time, I've only been writing for seven minutes now, wow. I hope I have fun this weekend. I'm excited about the UT football game. The last game was so much fun even though it was raining. I guess that made it more interesting. I'm looking at my pictures by my desk now and I really miss my friends from my hometown. I really miss PROPNAME, I hope she is doing fine at ORGNAME ORGNAME. And PROPNAME, I hope he is still not mad at me. Maybe I should call him tomorrow, I think I will. And I can't believe PROPNAME got her nose pierced up in LOCNAME. She is a wild one, but I guess that makes her who she is. I wish I was in LOCNAME. I love the mountains and the nice weather there. I bet she is having a great time at school. I'm spacing out right now. I never thought I could have writer's block when I'm writing about what's going through my head. That's really weird. And I'm saying really\" a lot. I guess I like that word or something, who knows. I need to go to the bathroom, but I only have about seven more minutes, so I'm just going to wait it out. Is going to even a word?  I'm not sure. I'm thinking about tomorrow again and hoping that my TA for Calculus teaches well tomorrow. I can't really understand him and I really need help in that class, so hopefully he will have some good things to say. Our sink in the room keeps on dripping and it's really bothering me. I wish it would stop. PROPNAME just got a phone call, I wonder who it is?  She is a cool girl, I'm glad I'm rooming with her. If I had to room with a complete weirdo I would freak out. That would be horrible. I think she is talking to her somewhat \"boyfriend. \"  They're dating I guess, and I set them up!  I did a good job. I guess he is coming up to our room right now. PROPNAME's excited!  I wish my boyfriend was coming to see me. He lives in LOCNAME so I understand. I hope PROPNAME doesn't think I'm a complete slob when he comes up here since I'm in my pajamas and have no make up on. Oh well, I don't need to impress him anyways. It just got really quiet in our room. It's an awkward silence because PROPNAME just turned her fan off. She must be cold, but why and I so hot. I just popped my back and it felt so good. It's been pretty sore lately, but I'm not sure why. I just remembered that I have to read after this. That really sucks. It's going to be a long night I guess, but I can handle it. Oh PROPNAME is here now, that's cool. \nAsnwer:"
