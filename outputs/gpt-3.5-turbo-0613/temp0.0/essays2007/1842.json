No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      Right now i am in my dorm room recovering from classes and preparing for an evening filled mostly with studying. My ears are receiving the wonderful sounds of PROPNAME PROPNAME, Jackopierce & PROPNAME PROPNAME, and also PROPNAME PROPNAME ( a Camp Allen classic). I can not say that i am smelling anything particularly because my sinuses are acting up after a game of soccer last night. I guess there is just something about the grass down by the ORGNAME fountains that fires up my histamines.         I am feeling a little anxious and stressed right now. I woke up at 00:00 this morning just as my first class was starting. This class is small and very much attendance based, so i could not simply skip it. I had to rush out the door and i believe that this rush has caused me to feel as though in race all day. The stress comes from the inability to finish a project for that class as a result of my oversleeping. I know the professor was not proud and i am afraid my grade will suffer as a result. I want to keep my grades up so that i will be able to easily transfer to any school because right now i do not believe that i will be able to cut it for 0 years in architecture school. For now i am committed to finishing this semester and evaluating things from there.         My mind just wandered back to Psychology class today. Dr. PROPNAME really angered me when he suggested that one of the greatest christians of all time and that spirituality and religion are all frauds and conjured up by our temporal lobes. He said that PROPNAME saw a vision of Christ after he fell on the road to damascus because he probably hit or damaged his temporal lobe. Well PROPNAME saw a blinding light that caused him to fall and afterward he was blind, which would not be caused by damage to the temporal lobe. Furthermore, other people had received visions of what was to happen and to receive PROPNAME into their homes as a result of the events. There i've said my piece.         I just realized that the music i'm listening to makes me miss my friends. One is called   Please Come to LOCNAME   and it talks about trying get together with old friends as this person is moving on with their own life. It has the same effect on me. I want my friends to come visit me on campus, but for some reason it would feel like a step back for me to go visit them. The other song is one from the christian summer camp i worked at for the past three summers. it just takes me back there with all of my friends and the summer love. We still talk occasionally, but only over the internet and not on the phone. I really prefer talking face to face if at all possible and then the phone and lastly the internet. It just seems so impersonal to talk on the internet with instant messages. Plus you can not fully express yourself; sarcasm for example is hard to decipher when written.         Wow, i actually wrote for twenty minutes and enjoyed it. this was actually a little therapeutic to express myself like this. \nAsnwer:"
