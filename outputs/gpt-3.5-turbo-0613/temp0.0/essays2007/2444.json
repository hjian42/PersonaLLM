I wonder why my roommate does the stuff she does, and why is this person talking so what is wrong with his hear okay it is really starting to stink. oh crap I'm supposed to meet my roommate for lunch but oh well it doesn't matter, this is much more important. Last night the ORGNAME music wards were so crazy, there were a lot of crazy things happening everywhere, I thought I was going to flip. I absolutely loved what PROPNAME and PROPNAME PROPNAME were wearing. I wonder when will Destiny's child get back together hopefully soon.
