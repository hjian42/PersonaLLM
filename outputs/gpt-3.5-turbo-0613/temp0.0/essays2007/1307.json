No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: When I came to LOCNAME I thought that school was going to be very difficult and that I would not meet anyone new. These are both wrong. So far I have met many new people and I feel as if school is not going to be as hard as I had expected. I love my classes and the diversity of students in them. Diversity to some people is a bad thing, but I love it. I think it is great to any environment to have people from every different ethnic or religious background. My favorite band, the PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME, has a lead singer named PROPNAME PROPNAME. He is from LOCNAME LOCNAME, although he is Caucasian, he considers himself to be of a South African background. He sings many songs that talk about the problems with diversity in the world today and in years before. He is a great man and I love his songs. I went to the concert in LOCNAME last night and watched the people around. Everyone seems to love him. I feel that he is my inspiration. His songs have such meaning and I feel that every song that he sings relates to me in some way. During the concert he was so moved by his music that he would dance and play around on stage. He is such an entertainer and performer that it would be impossible for anyone not to like him or his band. Each person on the band has a unique talent. PROPNAME PROPNAME is the violinist, and can play jams for hours at a time. He is very talented and used to have a band of his own before he joined the PROPNAME PROPNAME Band. PROPNAME PROPNAME is the wind instrument player. I cannot really specify what instrument he plays because he plays over 00 different instruments, and all of which he plays to perfection. During concerts he must where sunglasses because he is so shy that he closes his eyes during the entire time of which he is playing. PROPNAME PROPNAME is the drummer. He is probably the most talented member of the band, besides PROPNAME of course. Recently he was ranked the number one drummer in the world. Another member of the band is PROPNAME PROPNAME. He plays the bass guitar for the band. He joined the band in his junior year of high school. He is the youngest member of the band. Finally, PROPNAME Matthews plays lead acoustic guitar for the band. He is probably one of the most talented songwriters in the world today. The band last year had the highest profit grossing summer tour which made over 00 million dollars. Before Dave started the band he used to bartend at a local bar in LOCNAME called PROPNAME's. This is important because he met all the members of the band bartending at that bar. He ended up starting the band in 0000 and didn't get all the members to actually commit until 0000. Every year the band becomes more popular and more popular. But, the initial reason why the band became so popular in the very beginning was because the band allowed fans to plug into the soundboard and create tapes. These tapes where then copied and passed onto many other people, and through this very system of tape trading the band's popularity grew at exponential rates. Nowadays, people can just use Napster to trade songs, but back in the early nineties people actually had to trade the tapes in person or through the mail. This band is my inspiration and I hope that they will live forever in my mind and in the mind of the people who hears their music. \nAsnwer:"
