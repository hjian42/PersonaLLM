I need to do this in order to get credit. I wonder what the other writing assingments are going to be like. This song is good. Why do people like to fake tan?  Isn't that unhealthy?  This song is old school. I love it. I wish the longhorns were playing football this weekend. At least there are some good games between LOCNAME and LOCNAME, and Between Oklahome and LOCNAME. Damn I hate the sooners. They are jerks. Those guys at the cotton bowl last year were asses. I hope the 'horns' beat the crap out of them. I can't type today. i need to go to the SI sesion today to see whats going on in psychology. I should also look for a song to play before class. I love it when teachers put music on, or just simply do something out of the ordinary. It helps to remind students that the teacher is somewhat human. I hate it when teachers are very friendly or exciting. I wonder why teachers even bother to teach if they don't look like they enjoy it. Crap I can't type well at all today. Allright, new song. to slow. there we go. Good ol' Green Day. Damn they put on a great show this summer. It had to be the best concert I have seen. Blink 000 could have done better but their sound sucked bad. You couldn't understand them half the time. I wonder why the heck that is?  They headlined the tour and they have millions of dollars. you would think they could have a good sound to them. I wonder if there are any good concerts coming up here in austin. Box Car Racer is coming. Don't have money to go. Crappy song. changing. I wish PROPNAME would send the title to the car so I can get it registered and actually drive it. Man i love that car. I can't wait to drive it. I am so glad I didn't hurt myself in my wreck. I love this music. Why do movies and tv shows put music to them. I mean in real life there is no music playing when you are running around and stuff. I wonder why it seems natural to us when we see it on tv. Man this is a long writing asignment. I am glad to be done with school for the day. Tomorrow is an easy day also. rock on. I want to go up to tcu to hang out with evan. We had a great time last year. I can't believe we bought a douche bag. . hahaha that was freaking hilarious. We were absolutely insane. I miss those guys. i also like it here though. PROPNAME wasn't as bad as I make it out to be. We actually had some good times. Derricks camaro is so freakin fast he scared the crap out me driving that thing. I hope my car has some pick up. I need to take a shower my hair is nasty. I hate when its all tangled and stuff. not this song. great tune. You got to love the Chilli Peppers. I need to see PROPNAME tonight. We don't have much time to spend with her having night classes. She is a great girl though and very beautiful I can't believe I am with her. We need to go out on a date soon. When is our next break I am already tired of school I just want to be a bum for a few more weeks. Our walls need more stuff on them. PROPNAME PROPNAME is a total babe. She was so cute in Star Wars episode 0. PROPNAME was so awesome when he fought. That was the sweetest thing i had ever seen in a starwars flick. He totally kicked ass. I hope he does it again in the next episode. When does the next episode come out anyway. Isn't there a new matrix movie coming out soon too i can't wait to see that one also. That chick on LOCNAMEn idol last night had a big but. She was a lot better singer than the guy was. She deserved to win I wonder how much money she is going to make now that she is a star basically all over america and the world for that matter. That would be so sweett to be normal and then one day be makin mad cash and being all over america pop culture. Not for me though I'll just be a normal PROPNAME.    \nAsnwer:"
