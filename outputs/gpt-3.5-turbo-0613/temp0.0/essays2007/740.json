Here I am doing my college homework and it seems as  though just the other day I was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in  elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you  know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in  college. Time flies and friends come and go. I have met so many people since I  have been at this enormous school. I have come to realize that you must take  initiative in order to succeed. For instance, I am currently majoring in  theatre, but I don't know if that's what I really want to do with my life. If I  don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far I can go, I  will never figure out if theatre is the way I want to go or not. Then there's  the question of what I'd do if I didn't major in theatre. I know that I  wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 0rd time I've had to  write this since I have had many computer troubles. I accidently erased the  first one and my friend's computer froze when I was writing the other one. I am  using my friend PROPNAME's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. Right now I'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from ORGNAME, and they're  talking about PROPNAME's hair. Some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he  doesn't want his hair cut. They think it looks like an 00s haircut but he begs  to differ. Anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. I just remembered that I have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my  room. I hope it's not stale. Maybe I can drink it with my over-do milk. It's  past the drinking date. This gum is very stale and I am getting hungry. If I  were in my room, I would eat my muffin or the chips that I didn't eat last week  because I had to get to class. You see, I feed the birds my second sandwich  because I'm full. Then I still have chips left over. Oh, well. The joys of  wednesday sack lunches from Towers. I'm used to sack lunches because I've eaten  a sack lunch every day in high school. The reason is that we eat in the  greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. Some of my friends  have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers  get mad. Ah, the good old days. PROPNAME and PROPNAME and PROPNAME want to order a  pizza. That sounds like a good idea. It's late and I have to get up early for  my intro to media class tomorrow. College is a time when it seems hard to get  any sleep. There's always something you've got to do, or just good old  fashioned procrastination. I mean, I don't procrastinate. This isn't even due  for another week or so, and here I am, already typing it for the 0rd time. PROPNAME  PROPNAME is on TV right now. I just learned that his CDs have a parental  advisory due to explicit content. Isn't that interesting. Funny how society  tries to censor our lives when in reality children are the currupt ones these  days. Like my friends. they're crazy. Children are exposed to so much, like  from TV. I never had cable growing up, so I don't know what it's like. We did  have channel 00, ORGNAME. That was nice. Now, we're listening to the Doors, which  reminds of A Midsummer Night's Dream because my high school did it in the 00's  and that was the music we used. Well, at least, we used some Doors music. We  used great 00s music. Then I was in A Midsummer Night's Dream in the 00s, and  we used original music written by one of the cast members. He wrote the tune  for The Wiz, and tranfered the words because of course PROPNAME didn't write  like the music in The Wiz. PROPNAME just called a guy because his number was on a  dollar bill. He's crazy, but that is what makes life fun. Then there's PROPNAME  with his mushroom haircut and PROPNAME, who some say looks like PROPNAME PROPNAME, but in  reality, he looks nothing like PROPNAME PROPNAME. No more than the pizza guy, who  looks like a clown. I am afraid of clowns and I haven't even seen \"IT. \"   However, I did see a PROPNAME PROPNAME movie on New Years a couple years ago with 0  girls from LOCNAME. New's Years Day was 00 hours for me because I was  traveling back from LOCNAME. That was a great trip. Well, it's been 00 minutes  and I feel like there's not much else needed to say. \"Good morning, and in case  I don't se \nAsnwer:"
