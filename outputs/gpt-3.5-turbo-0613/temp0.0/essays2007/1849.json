I can just think about what I want to think about. Man I've got a three hour drive ahead of me today and i made the same drive yesterday. It was soooo boring. I wish i could just warp back to LOCNAME or something like that. But i like being back in LOCNAME. It's great to see my family and friends again. I miss them sometimes and the once or twice a month i get to see them are well worth it. But when my trip is over, I'm always eager to see my peeps in LOCNAME again and just to get back to normal life. I've got a lot of reading to do this weekend and i don't want to do it. It's alll textbook reading and i would much rather be reading PROPNAME PROPNAME or just not be reading at all. I wish i could type faster and that way i could type a lot. I've got to type as much as possible. Otherwise i won't be satisfied with my experiment. blankness. . i want some new CD's to listen to on the way back to LOCNAME. that way i wouldn't get a sbored as i was yesterday. and then the ride would weem much shorter. wow i still got thirteen minutes left. i wish i could slept in longer today but i had to wake up to make sure that i would finish this in time. i don't mind doing it but i'm jsut so dang lazy that this is even annnoying to me. I'm just not good at doing things that i don't want to do. oh well. i talked to PROPNAME last night and we talked about how things are diff. now because i moved to LOCNAME. all he does now is go out with girls since andy is going to LOCNAME LOCNAME and i'm already in LOCNAME. things have changed since i moved. i can't just go over to his house anytime i'm bored anymore  it's a three hour drive if i do. i miss those guys and my family more than i thought i would  it's weird being back at home. the place seems different. my room seems foreign to me because my parents cleaned it up and moved things around the week after i left for austin. i hope i'm not getting carpal tunnel syndrome, my wrists are getting kind of sore and my arms are already sore from playing racuetball the other day. it was fun thought and i'm probly going to play again today or tomorrow. i'm looking forward to it. ahhh no more wrist pain. i hope my brother won't get mad at me for stealing his computer chair but it makes my wrists feel so much better. WOW my phones loud it just scared the crap out of me when it rang see there it is!  typing is sooo much easier whne your in a  computer chair and not a dining room chair. i wonder what you'll think when your reading this or if anyone's even going to read it. hmmmmmmm.  i need to leave pretty soon so i don't hit LOCNAME's rush hour but there is so much stuff i need to get done with here. wow the opportunity cost sucks. three more minutes. i only got a few more minutes and then no more of this mind to page thing. after that i can just think and not have to type it up or anything ike that. i hope LOCNAME wins tonight and moves up in LOCNAME's rankings and ORGNAME state rankings. they are relaly good and deserve to be high up in all rankings. likewise i hope ORGNAME kicks NC's butt tomorrow because UT IS all that and a huge bag of potato chips. then maybe they could move ahead of LOCNAME in the AP rankings because everyone knows we're better than those north of the red river weirdos  who cares about the sooners anyway. PROPNAME sucks and their second and third strigers are both freshmen and that's really going to hurt em bad. oh well we'll see on October 00th. GO HORNS!!! \nAsnwer:"
