No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I don't really know how to start a \"stream ORGNAME consciousness\" writing, but I guess I will write about how I feel about college right now. It PROPNAME my first year and it is really scary but fun at PROPNAME same time. I guess I haven't really had enough time to sit down and think about all that I have done since I have been here. It is exhausting to think how much I have actually been doing. I'm not a morning person so my days start around 00:00. From that point on I do not stop until about 00am, when I pass out. My days are filled completely with going to class, studying, meetings, and then of course going out. I have met so PROPNAMEy people since I have been here. I barely remember anyone's name. I feel so bad when someone comes up to me and calls me by my name and I can't even remember ever meeting them. I'm sure that has happened to everyone before, but it seems to happen to me at least once a day. Oh well, life goes on. At least I remember my roommate's name. She is cool! We both went potluck and got extremely lucky. We get along like sisters, and people even think we look alike. It's crazy. This writing seems like a bunch of gibber gabber but I guess I am following the guidelines by writing what is on my mind. I think this is a cool exercise because it is actually giving me the time to sit down and think about what's on my mind. One thing that is always on my mind is how I miss home. I am used to my mom always taking care of almost everything for me. That makes me sound like a baby, but I am an independent person. I took care of my mom for two years while she was in bed sick. That was the point in my life when I grew up really fast. I had to go to work and school, cook dinner, go to the cleaners, and everything that I could do to help out around the house. When she got better, I guess is when I became lazy and wanted her to help me do a lot of things. She is awesome and I really miss her. My PROPNAME is an entire different story. He lives in LOCNAME and does not do one thing for anybody except himself. He didn't raise us so he doesn't really know how to act like a father. My step dad is the man who acts as my father. He takes care of me the way my father is supposed to. I really miss him as well. If it weren't for him I would not be typing this essay on this computer, or going to the ORGNAME of ORGNAME as well. I am very thankful for everything he has done for me. I am bad at showing it sometimes, but I think he knows in my heart how appreciative I am. Another thing that I miss is my sister. She goes to ORGNAME ORGNAME. I tell her everything because she is my best friend. I don't know what I would do without the telephone. She makes me feel better whenever I have a problem or am upset. I guess this entire essay is about how much I miss my family. I am thinking that maybe I should go home soon and visit. Actually that could be bad, I need to grow up someday. I have two more minutes that I have to write. I feel better about being away from home now that I have expressed what I miss on paper. I have always heard when you write things down it makes you feel better, and this just proved that to me. I hope this makes some since. Goodbye have a good day! \nAsnwer:"
