No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I was wanting to get that pre-testing stuff out of the way, but like most every body else in the fucking class I logged on right after the class, and now the damn test site won't respond. Knowing me, I'm going to forget about it or something. I was just in the mood at the time, and it was on my mind you know? So now I decide to polish off something else (this thing) in hopes that when I'm done, the other will be free. Before I go on, I know that you may read this and think, boy this kid sure is edgy or sure gets irritated about a lot of stuff, and you know what? I DO! anyway, since I'm on this whole you know what I hate kick, I'll just tell you things that irritate me that have happened to me recently. For one thing, the battery in my watch went out this morning, and I went to buy a new battery for it today, but can't replace the old one cause I don't have a fucking screwdriver SMALL enough. So now I'm walking around campus wearing a watch that doesn't work and continuously looking at it to know the time. And every time I look at the damn thing, it's blank and I remember that it doesn't work I get mad at myself. And soda machines piss me off too cause every time I really thirst for a particular drink and push the button for that particular drink, I most always get something else. And of course you're left with this drink that you don't want, yet you don't want to just throw it away cause you just spent your last 00 cents on it. Anyway. . ok so how's the family? good? that's great. no serious0e0ly to continue the theme of today's \"stream of consciousness\" let's talk about music. Now, I listen to all kinds of music ranging from frank sinatra to Fear Factory, so I not judgmental in terms of genre of music, but my friends and I go out from time to time to see bands in LOCNAME perform that are, in our opinion good, without record deals much less ORGNAME support meanwhile talentless bands successful solely due to sex appeal (PROPNAME, No Doubt in particular) thrive. Now you may say, but PROPNAME what about the Spice girls do you hate them? And my answer oddly enough is no. Why? Cause they are all about sex appeal and they know it. PROPNAME and No Doubt actually think they're serious musicians. times up. \nAsnwer:"
