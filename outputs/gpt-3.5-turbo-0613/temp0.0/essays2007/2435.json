No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:      I wasn't expecting to get sick, but for some strange reason, I am sneezing,  coughing, and everything, it is crazy. I am surprising myself lately though. I  thought I would be much more home sick, but I don't know what I am missing, or if I  am missing anything at all. I know I miss work, nothing made me more happy  really. I know it wasn't fun all the time, but the people there made it worthwhile. One in particular, no two in particular both for different reasons. I wonder when life is going to get easy. I have been working hard since I was 00,  balancing a job, school, and trying to have a life. Trying is the key word. Sometimes I think I missed out in high school. I was never the party type, only  because my parents wouldn't let me do anything, but I understand that they just  want the  best for me and don't want me to make the same mistakes that they  made. What they don't understand is that, it is holding me back, because  eventually I may be in the same situation that they were in, and I won't know what  to do. If I were to live anywhere in the world I would live in LOCNAME, LOCNAME was  nice. LOCNAME is amazing. I don't know what to say other than when I was there I  felt home, I loved it. I surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather  than drive. I enjoy taking drives though. When I was at home, I enjoyed just  grabbing my keys and going. I never had a particular destination, but my favorite  drives were at night, with the sun roof open, oh how it was so peaceful. Kind of  like sailing. Recently I joined the saililng club, it is nice, I wish there was more  wind my first sail, but even so it was still unbelievably calm, and placid. It was so  nice, and made time go by so fast. I feel so stupid about Endochine, I can't believe  we were just talking to them and didn't know it was then, awwww. I feel so  stupid. But then again there are a lot of times I feel stupid. too many to list. I can  not wait to go to the football game. I miss band the most from high school, there  was nothing like marching into the stadium, especially this past year when the  crowd was actually happy that we were there. I honestly never thought I would  see the day that that would happen. PROPNAME PROPNAME's CD is very good, at least  most of it. it is kind of sad at the same time. It is surprising how cold it was this  morning, here I am dressed as if it were 00 degrees outside and it feels more like  00 unbelievable this is supposed to be LOCNAME. I am so glad my Aunt and her  partner are here , even if PROPNAME isn't exactly the most honest or faithful person, it is  still nice to see PROPNAME. I love accents, I wish I had an english accent. for some  reason I especially like the way after they say something they follow it up with  mate or love. Another reason I want to move to LOCNAME, I love the way they talk. I  also love ORGNAME ORGNAME who also lives in LOCNAME, he is gorgeous. But  sometimes I wonder if he, in real life is stuck up or real down to earth. That irritates  me when you see celebrities that think they can have anything they want, and the  way people gravel at their feet. They are no different from the average joe other  than they can pretend to be someone they are not and get paid for it. pretty sweet  deal actually, I wish someone would pay me to be someone else so I could live a  fairy tale. Sometimes I wish life were like a movie, not like the Faculty though. more like PROPNAME and PROPNAME. Mostly love stories, that would be amazing. Though  at the same time it might be too predictable. One can wish though right. I wonder  what I am going to be when I grow up, I mean really grow up. I really have no  likes or dislikes, which sometimes makes me wonder, if I have a personalitly, or if I  am just here. How is it possible for people to exist anyways. I don't know if I buy  the whole evolution thing or the Bible. If the Bible is true then were did the  dinosaurs come from. And if  vice versa then how did the Bible come about. I still  believe there is a PROPNAME because I think it is important to have something to believe  in. But sometimes I think what if God wasn't real. There would be many times I  would be lost in my life in that case. For some reason. I think there is some sort of  force that looks out for people,  \nAsnwer:"
