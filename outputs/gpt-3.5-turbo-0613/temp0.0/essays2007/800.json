No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Well, I'm confused with my computer, its unusually working slowly and it freezes a lot. I gave my computer to my friend PROPNAME who fixed the major problem of it. When I turned my computer on it would never load windows and the start up menu would appear. I thought that he broke it because he came from UH up here last week and he clocked my computer from 000MHz to 000MHz. After he left and I tried my computer it would not load Windows and the start up menu would always appear. So this labor day weekend I came home, my parents were shocked to see me because I forgot to tell them that I was coming. But they were happy and kept asking me how college is and giving me tips of not goofing around too much. I also went to eyemasters in West oaks mall there I was very shocked to see my friend PROPNAME who is now a junior in high school but I still think of her as a freshmen because shes like a little sister to me. Everyone thinks she's very gorgeous I now think so too because I never thought of her that way. Anyways she told me her brother was getting her a job there because he works there. But she told me she didn't want to work there because her brither is there and she has to act a certain way and I know what she means. Her brother PROPNAME is huge, he's probably 00 yrs old and he goes to UH. Well, I saw her there but I didn't say much, it was really busy I wish I could talk to her but I just said something on the lines of \"nice to see you, well bye\" I went to eyemasters to get nose pads for my glasses. I use those glasses to play basketball with. But I saw prescription goggles there and that's what I've been looking for, they costed one hundred dollars though, I'll probably get them with my work study money, once I start recieving it. Yeah, I work at PROPNAME hall and I the Jester media center ehich is upstairs. PROPNAME PROPNAME is my boss and he's really cool. He smokes and curses and is a gradute  of LOCNAME with a 0. 00 ORGNAME!!  I really hope I do well in my first year at LOCNAME, my classes aren't extremely hard, but everyones like college is nothing like high school its very hard. Actually I see college as not hard but just a level. You have so much free time, you are 00% of the time out of class. So there;s a lot of time to study an make good grades. The bad part is you can never slack off more than a couple of times, and that's where I see people make their mistakes, I've seen and heard of so many people I know do very bad with horrendous GPA's and I don't understand. Do these people realize how lucky they are to be in college? To improve on certain skills to make incredible amounts of money. Most do but some idiots don't and that's why there all crying by their junior or senior years in college hen they realize they should have chosen their books most of the time over their friends. I know I barely studied and still got good grades in high school, but I know college is a lot different. I have to manage my time wisely and study and do homework all the time and everyday, then goof around over the weekends whenever I surely have free time. Well, my twenty minutes are up. \nAsnwer:"
