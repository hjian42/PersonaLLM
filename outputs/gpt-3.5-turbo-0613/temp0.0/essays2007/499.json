No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: I just sent him an email message. actually, we are having , well not really problems, it is just hard because of the distance. It makes me feel like maybe I made the wrong decision by coming all the way here. I didn't really have a good reason, other than I knew I wanted to go out of state and this is a really good business school. Everyone asks why I came here. I'm sick of explaining it. I wish there were more out of state students here. I was really homesick the other day I just couldn't wait until thanksgiving. I couldn't sleep at all. Hmmm. that's just what we talked about in class today. Whether people would sleep longer if they were sad, or f they would have trouble sleeping. I just felt terrible. It was the first time I'd ever been that homesick. However, I've never really been this far away from home before, and for this amount of time.   I wonder if all these papers are going to be approximately the same length, or if people who type slower will have really short papers. It's only been like 0 minutes so far. I wish I typed slower. We had to do some kind of journal similar to this in My freshman English Class. We would give them names and everyday, we had to write for ten minutes about whatever first came into our heads. Back then I thought what a waste of time, but now I wish all our assignments were like this. It's great mot having to think of making sure all the sentences are in the right tense or I am using works correctly. I'm not in my room right now. I'm borrowing the computer ozone of my neighbors. and his suitemate just walked in with dinner. It smells really good. Now I'm hungry. I tried reading the first chapter in my psychology book over the weekend. I don't know, I just get so discouraged because I have a really short attention span especially when not reading \"Reader friendly material\"  I just can't concentrate on it. I've tried lots of methods, like taking notes and speaking it aloud while I'm reading it and all sorts of stuff. It just doesn't seem to work. Don't get me wrong, I think this will be my favorite class this year, It is just hard to digest. I'm glad I didn't take Psychology in High School. Supposedly, the teacher was really hard and the class was pretty useless. Instead, I took all hard classes. That's why I'm here. Because I was one of the 00 out of state students who were accepted into the school of business administration. I feel bad telling people that though. It makes me feel stuck-up. I don't want to be stuck up. I know too many people who are and I see others talking behind their backs. I really don't want that to ever happen. Actually, I'm pretty happy with myself the way it is (or was in LOCNAME)  I had a lot of really close friendships that I left behind. Some are still kind-of open ended, I didn't get to say goodbye, and other things like that. I made my plane tickets today. I get to leave on Tuesday to go home for thanksgiving, and on the 00th for christmas. I can't wait. I want to see how everyone has changed, and I guess, hope that they didn't change too much. Some I was worried about because they like to take things as they come into play and don't really think about how it might affect them in the future. I just want them to be safe. PROPNAME just asked if I wanted any of his soup. I guess that is what he got for dinner. He's nice. actually all the guys next door are nice. My roommate however will take some getting  used to. She is Muslim and I'm Christian. We kind of clash with religious opinions. Well, I guess I'm done now! \nAsnwer:"
