I don't understand any of the psychology professor pennebaker is talking about. what does he mean is this a good experiment? How can you tell? I hope the si session will help. I can wait for PROPNAME to come up here. I'm going to be so tired by sat. kris is nice, I hope I can get him a ticket. ;crap, meeting tonight. I need shoes though,. maybe ill skip it and go with LOCNAME, but I need to go to the store on the drag. its so cold in here. I miss sheniel. she is great. I need a nap. I hope PROPNAME doesn't get me sick, that would suck,. what is PROPNAME going to do at the party. I hope PROPNAME doesn't get upset with me for that. I don't have enough tshirts. I hope I can sneak him and bobby in. what are they going to do if I get caught? I don't know, PROPNAME did it successfully. I can't spell anything or type right. this assignment isn't hard, I hope they are all this easy because I know I'm going to have trouble in this class. I want it to rain real bad. I miss my mom and PROPNAME. I wonder what daddy is doing. I need some music in here. Doug better burn me a cd too. I can't believe my mom bought that frame for me. I wonder if she might like him now. I don't even see him now. maybe that's why she likes him. I don't want to get sick. I don't have a mommy. I sound like PROPNAME. very immature and youngish. I need to grow up, I'm referred to as a woman now. what ever. my hands and wrists hurt from typing. I'm not used to this. I hated my teacher. he was fat and old. why does my computer do that? It so annoying. I need to get excel on here. maybe I should buy it. 0 bucks not bad. damnit it's doing it again! I hate this. stupid red lines, I know I spelled it wrong! PROPNAME is on again. I wish we were still good friends. why is the sun out? I want rain. my head itches. its too cold here. my right forearm is now aching. I need to take a shower. I should get started on that speech, I wonder if what I have is enough. I like PROPNAME. the is young looking. quiz. read chapter 0 and 00. PROPNAME said she skimmed it. ill do that instead, easier. still have to skim psych. I hate that class. I'm such an idiot. shouldn't be in there. I want chocolate. why do I have to wait like that! Stupid computer. he sheneil! Yea, she's back. why? What's wrong with them. I'm sorry, I wish I could help you. that sucks. you maybe, mine are bothering me too. I'm getting too much drainage. I don't want to get sick. I haven't been coughing again, so that's good. this a such a weird assignment. I can't believe the thing said I haven't turned it in. I did it twice now. what a waste of time. he won't even read this. I could say fuck you pennebaker and he wouldn't know. not like id really say it, he is a funny guy, I am just dumb about his material. he doesn't stick to the book and give us good notes. I hate experiments. shit I still have to do economics. I can't get the hang of this college thing. PROPNAME is gone. I wanted to talk to him when I was done with this. I love PROPNAME. I can't wait until Friday. at least I can sleep on the way up there. I still have 00 minutes left. damn this assignment. I like sheneil a lot. its weird to know I'm saying one thing to her and thinking another. I'm so bored. I have other things to be doing instead of this. ok, think a little bit more about the speech and read, no skim, the rest of ch0 for psy, like that will help. this is hard because I can't spell and this computer is retarded. I hate this ;laptop! Who invented this anyways. I don't even take it to class. because I can't type and all my notes would not make any sense. sorry grandma. oh well, she doesn't know. I want chocolate right now. PROPNAME cookies. brynn is a very weird girl. I'm going to ha to spell check this, I hope that's allowed, other wise. well they wont read it anyways. www. psy. utexas. edu/what is is? Jp000 I think. I hate this chair. I want my one from home. i'll get it later when I go home. gnome? what is that? Ok time up \nAsnwer:"
