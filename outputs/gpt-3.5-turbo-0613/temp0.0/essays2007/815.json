No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: The day has flown by, work computer science homework, but it was a nice day, I was wearing black which was dumb because the sun was shining and it was really hot. U know about how black seems to attract the most colors or that the most colors get absorbed so it actually makes everything hotter. Plus I was wearing jeans which made it worse, I would have actually preferred to wear shorts but going to work on the first day wouldn't have been smartest with dressing so casually know what I mean? but anyways  back to the point. I met some interesting people today. I talked to PROPNAME for a while actually only a couple of sentences I had to go soon. but I wanted to go to the TA to see if he can help me with my cs homework turned out he wasn't there. don't know where he went. but I don't care tho. actually I did, u know how things seem to be worse when nothing seems to be going ur way? well it's almost quiet right now, I think the crickets are chirping which is horrible because its really annoying. typically I'm not a violent person. but it's something about crickets. I have no idea. I don't know what it is. PROPNAME is asking what it is and she was checking to see if it was the AC I hope that the crickets aren't in the room, it's like frogs croaking at nite before u go to sleep or the heater going on. but it's hard to concentrate with all that noise. but I think I can manage. anyways what was I talking about? oh yeah my cs homework, I came back from work and just asked PROPNAME for some help since he has a computer I went at around one thirty becuase I came back at around one from work grabbed my computer and talked to kevin and then went down to PROPNAME to see PROPNAME play the piano, I just asked him to come with me to Painter. good! finally the chirping has stopped some guy is banging on the AC poor crickets. but it's finally stopped cool!! anyways I went to the dorm room in jester which was a fifteen minute walk. fifteen minutes sometimes is a long way but not when ur determined. fifteen minutes is to gregory gym, which is good but sometimes when I'm walking to RLM it seems like it'll take forever and I'm just five minutes away, why does it seem to be so far?  I needed to take a break sometimes. which is totally weird. oh well. hmm. there's a coke can around me and it's been there for a couple of nites actually only around three days or around two. martin got it for me the day before and I just decided to leave it in the fridge. I should probably just recycle it. the recycling bin isn't that far away. only like a two second walk actually around one minute. more or less. give or take a few it's near the trashcan and stuff it's kept in the washing room. it has a washing machine and a dryer and also it has like a sign-up sheet so that people can get to it easier instead of waiting u just take a time period of around three hours u know? anyways it's an iron board in there and a broom and mop. which reminds me that the room is getting dirty. looking at the computer it looks really cool. it's miniature, I almost didn't want to get it because sony is discontinuing it and u know I thought there was something with it. I don't know. u know that most people don't want stuff that's going out. but this is  a silver and metallic purple color. I was at work for an hour just sorting out papers of different colors there was buff, metallic orange, canary yellow and all these various colors which is strange because there are the brites and the normal colors which are paler. but I'm already done. so guess this is the end. \nAsnwer:"
