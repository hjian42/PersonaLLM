    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: Wow. what an assignment. I can barely type. I hope I will learn to write better. I keep listening to rosie on tv. A soda sounds good. I wonder when I will finally get mail. My parents were supposed to send me some stamps. I bet they got stolen. I wonder if avery will ever write to me. He says that he wrote me a letter like a week ago. Well were is it. I wonder if I will last for 00 minutes. I wonder what PROPNAME and mine relationship will be like while he is on his mission. I feel like a machine right now. I went to the health clinic. That was kind of weird but everyone was nice to me. It is so normal for someone to be sexually active. THey are so surprised to hear they you are a virgin. I was raised right and I actually learned what they taught. Some people have to learn the hard way at the expense of others. Abortion is the worst thing someone can just blow off. just because someone is being stupid and lustful they feel when they get pregnant that their mistakes should not come with the consequences. I wish I could watch PROPNAME of eat something instead of this. It is kind of fun though. I wonder if PROPNAME is coming down this weekend to visit me. My stupid computer will not ever work. My roommate is nice to let me borrow her computer. I wonder what mandy and PROPNAME are doing. I have a message from my sister. I think it is PROPNAME. She has been so helpful. I need to concentrate. I need to read my scriptures. How much longer do I have to write. My fingers are about to fall off. I keep making so many mistakes. AAAHHH! this is frustrating trying to keep up with my thoughts. This sure does help my writing speed. go girl go. I want to call sheila. I wonder if they are cooking or something. I already have a sandwich in the refrigerator from lunch. That is so stupid that they don't allow you to take food out of the cafe. I did. I paid for it. They just want to reap you off. Well I won't let them. I can't think I am thinking too hard. I wonder what avery is doing. I wish I could talk to him. It is driving me almost to the point of worry. I wonder if the mail is here yet. I am so glad this assignment is easy. I wonder what kind of awful things people write. I feel almost sorry for the professors that have to read this. I bet it will take forever. I wonder what kind of experiments I will participate in. My shoulder hurts. I wonder how often I will actually work out. I am so sore. How much longer. YEs 0 minutes. Praise the lord. I said a curse word today and I am not happy with myself. I don't want to get back into that habit. I am not a happy or truly happy person when I curse. It is not a nice thing to do. I wonder what the professors are thinking. I waited for the bus forever today. I thought I was going to die in this heat. My writing is getting worse. I am getting a headache. I wonder what it would be like to have a cat. I like twinkles but cats are so moody. I miss my dog PROPNAME. the cutest thing in the world. I wonder what they are doing at home. I wonder what they are eating. I am hungry. I miss eating with PROPNAME. will he ever write me. Is he too busy. I never heard of that. I am starting to get mad now. he was all worried about me dating other guys and he doesn't even take the effort to buy a stamp and mail it. I wonder if it got lost. I hope I get one soon. I am finally done. \nAsnwer:"
