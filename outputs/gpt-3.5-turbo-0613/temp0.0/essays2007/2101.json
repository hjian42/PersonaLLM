Today was a pretty interesting day. I met a lot of people who spoke Spanish, so that made me feel more at home. This stupid bracelet is bothering me. I miss PROPNAME, my ex-boyfriend. I wonder if anyone's going to read this nonsense, and who ever is reading this, I feel sorry for them. I'm not that cool in my head. My room mate is gone. She is bowling. I wonder what she is doing. Maybe sitting there bored. She is always bored everywhere we go she has this face, that makes me bored. I miss my family, even though when I'm there I don't really talk to them. I guess I'm just used to them being around. I wonder if I'm prone to meningitis? Should I get the shot?  Knowing my luck, if I don't get, I'll be well, to dead in 00 hours. I'm scared of needles. Damn, I'm scared of everything!    Oh, crap almost erased everything I had written. Computers are not for me. What is for me?  I like Psychology. The lectures are super interesting. Do I have any better word?  Nah, interesting is an OK word. I feel so non-intellectual. See, that just shows my inability to express myself in words. Physically I'm very expressive. But I that's what I think. My ex probably doesn't think so. No, he does. I miss reading in U. I. L. I just realized that being in college makes you miss a lot of things. I wonder if I'm going to make it out of here?  Sometimes I meet people just like me and tell myself, don't worry you're not alone, but other times people are so articulate in class it intimidates me. I set a goal for myself when I first got here and I can't do it. I'm suppose to ask at least one question per class per week. But I just can't with all those people staring at me. Once I open my mouth, they're going to realize what an idiot I am. This sounds so clich\u00e9. Other people probably wrote all these philosophical questions on their stream of consciousness, like Why are we here? Did PROPNAME believe that as humans. Well, I don't write like that. I'm just a bundle of unanswered questions. Ahhh, my back's starting to hurt. I like that guy who walked me to my room. Is that all were suppose to write. OK never mind. That girl from LOCNAME is really nice. She reminds me of a friend from LOCNAME LOCNAME. I hope I meet more people like her. It'll help me sleep better. I've had really bad insomnia. I could be depressed or just a freshman in LOCNAME. Maybe both. I don't get what happened to my first letter in every sentence. It disappeared into the left side. What did I push?  OK 00 seconds left. I'm so glad I'm almost done with my first assignment. Is this what he wanted?  I hope I did this right. Bye. \nAsnwer:"
