It's really strange that that guy just stopped by. He is really friendly, but kind of creepy. He just comes in and talks to everybody. It's ok, I'm the same way; I'll sit and talk to anyone. Maybe I should close the door, so I won't get distracted; but then PROPNAME won't see that I'm here when he gets back. Oh well, he can knock. I'm so tired, but I don't think I can sleep tonight. It's so loud in our hall at night; I'll just have to start taking naps during the day when everyone is in class. Yeah right, rest?  I'm always in class; or studying. I spend more time studying than I spend in class; seems backwards. I can't wait until this weekend. Need to ask professor about ahhhh PROPNAME's calling. Need to go to admissions office and claim ORGNAME credit and change major. Need to ask PROPNAME about experiments. PROPNAME PROPNAME stops by, I'm kinda bored. This weekend will be fun; I haven't seen friends from home in a couple of weeks, so it'll be good to hang out with them. But what about PROPNAME?  I don't know how he is going to act now that we broke up. Should I tell him about PROPNAME?  Who cares?  I should call Uncle PROPNAME about kayaking; he really wants to go, and it will be a good stress reliever. Hope I have time; good memory. I think PROPNAME would really like it too. I don't really want to go home, haven't been gone long enough. Why wasn't anyone in the comp lab earlier to help me. Now I'll have to go again tomorrow. It's ok, tomorrow's easy. Can't wait to swim laps again; it's a good workout. I should keep lifting weights. I don't want to lose any more weight, but it would be nice to gain some muscle; I'll keep lifting weights. Oh, have to meet PROPNAME tomorrow for Cru. She is nice, I just don't know if I'll have time to meet in the small group regularly. That's terrible, I should never pick other things over Bible study. But I pray, and I should study on my own. I hope Annah starts going to church with me. LOCNAME eleven? Are they still in LOCNAME LOCNAME?  Is that where they went? I don't think so. Wow, this feels like when I'm working out and waiting for the twenty minutes to be up. I keep looking and the clock. Maybe I should put on some socks; these floors are really cold, and I think they're pretty dirty too. Yuck, who else has been barefoot here?  Where's PROPNAME, haven't seen her today. Where's my roommate?  She is always here. It's ok, this is nice. I need to go to the eye doctor, because I'm having trouble focusing. Glasses would be such a pain; I hope my vision gets better on its own. Will I have time to take Spanish every semester of college?  I hope so; it would be nice to be fluent. Very useful also if I work in LOCNAME. I have to stay in LOCNAME; it's too cold everywhere else. I love LOCNAME anyway. Austin too. It's so great to finally live here. And home isn't too far away. I'm not homesick yet. I just want my own bed. Jester beds suck. I have to be exhausted to get comfortable in them. I hope PROPNAME takes me out again soon. I had lots of fun with her. I need to spend time with PROPNAME too. I'm so glad we've been friends for so long. Even when we don't talk for a long time, she is always there. My eyes are tired. What's on tv?  Absolutely nothing interesting. Where's PROPNAME?  Maybe I'll call him. No, he is with a friend. He will call later. So many books, where to start?  Probably Spanish, I have that first. I need to stop eating so much candy. It's bad for my teeth and my body. Look, time's almost up. Yep, they're in LOCNAME LOCNAME, but only ten left. What's the point?  Who cares?  Does anybody pay attention anymore?  Did I ever?  Not me! \nAsnwer:"
