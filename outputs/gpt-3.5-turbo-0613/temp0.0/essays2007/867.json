I kind of wish that I had eaten lunch before I started this. is \"kind of\" actually a valid phrase in English?  I've heard it used in conversation, but I've never really seen it tuped before. I wonder why we capitalize some nouns like God and English, but not others like god and bicycle. the people down my hall are really loud and obnoxious. I'm not quite sure what they are doing now, but it involves a lot of bumping around. They had a picture of some female anatomy on their wipe-off board for a couple of days, but it's gone now. I'm really glad because it was pretty offensive. I wasn't about to say anything about it to them, though. who am I to tell them what they can display outside their door?  now I hear multiple guys laughing. I really don't like it when guys are in the dorm. it makes me really uncomfortable. I feel like I can't really go on with my regular living processes. I'm always afraid that if I take a late shower, I'll be coming down the hallway in my purple bathrobe, and there will be some strange guy standing there. I'm really into my privacy. that's why I chose an all girls dorm. besides, a lot of girls get really stupid and bitchy when they are around guys. last night when I was getting off the elevator with a friend, two girls from that floor were getting on. my friend and I were laughing at something she said, and one of the (not very nice) girls thrust her head out of the elevator and said \"do you have a problem?\" in a very threatening tone. I just laughed at her and said no. then she said, \"I didn't think so. \"  then why the hell did you ask if you didn't think so?  it sort of desturbed (wrong spelling, geez I hate that) me to think that someone was that bitchy where I live. I also feel sorry for her that she is so insecre that something like that would set her off. my mind goes faster than I can type. sometimes I worry that my writing is not sophisticated enough. I guess now I worry that my thought processes are not sophisticated enough. my roommate keeps trying to set me up with her friend. he's a nice guy, but the thought of getting together with him makes me a little sick. perhaps it's the dirty notes he keeps leaving on my bed when I'm not here. I'm not used to people being that upfront about sex. I noticed that sex is a big interest for psychologists. the first questionnaire I filled out had a substantial section on sex. I wonder if you guys are actually going to read this, or if I am writing this for my own benefit. if the latter is true, I'm not going to get much out of this. I write like this all the time; it's called a journal. it is slightly more enjoyable than many other alternatives I can think of, though. you're never supposed to end a sentence with a preposition. I wonder why that is. I rather like it. maybe because I'm not supposed to do it. well, it's 0:00 now, so I guess my requirement is up. besides, there's nothing more I can think of. \nAsnwer:"
