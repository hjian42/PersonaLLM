I am still trying to get the hang of college life and trying to cope with the new change. Everything here at LOCNAME is so different. College is different. It is not what I expected it to be or even what I had imagined. Do not get me wrong, I love ORGNAME, it is just that I am use to the High school ways. You know, the whole part of being spoon fed. Here I have to be responsible, be an adult, make my own decisions, and I am just not ready for that quite yet. LOCNAME is so huge and diverse. There are so many people and organizations. Right now I feel overwhelmed and a little out of place. I guess it is because I am a Freshman, but I know that I will get over it soon. I have been missing my family, friends, and boyfriend so much today. You see I have never really been away from home for more than a week, so this is really new to me. It is an experience. One that I know is going to change my life forever. All night I have been thinking of everything and how new all of it is, and it has made me a little scared and nervous. I have even felt a little stressed out about it. And now I have this thought in my head that I won't make it here at LOCNAME. But I know that it is just a thought and that all I have to do is adapt to this new change and work my hardest to make it be successful. I have four years here at LOCNAME. I plan to make them the best. Besides, I have always loved this school. Ever since I was a little girl this has been my dream school. And now that I am here I am going to make the best of it. I have the pride. I have the spirit. All I need to do is believe in myself and do my very best. LOCNAME is the best and I am very glad that I chose to come here. So in all, I guess the way I am feeling is pretty normal for a Freshman. I just need to get the hang of things and everything will be alright. Hook 'em Horns. \nAsnwer:"
