    "user_prompt": "Does the following text contain a personal story?\nAnswer YES or NO. No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: The Complete Works of Shakespere is a very large book and although I've skimmed  through King PROPNAME and PROPNAME and a little bit of the old Twelfth Night, I reckon  it would take me about a year and a half reading every day to get through that  whole book. I'm glad I could change my schedule during add/drop because getting  up at eight just would have not happened at all. PROPNAME PROPNAME, she lastest and  the greatest of them all. did you know the world was waiting just for you oo ooo  PROPNAME PROPNAME or PROPNAME, however big you think you are areaeaereare. You'll get  yours yet. PROPNAME's massage to the alternative take to this song. All those  weird little encounters. This assignment better be like confidential. A man's  thoughts word for word over twenty minutes by definition should be filled with  nasty gutter talk and such, but for the sake of the grader, this stream of  continuous mental blabber shall be filtered convieniently for filthynesses sake. Helter Skelter would you want me to make you? Tell me tell me tell me the answer  Helter Skelter Helter Skelter Helter Skelter ooooooo!  Aw here she come! Nice  slide guitar work ther, PROPNAME, when I get to the botom I go back to the top of  the slide Do you don't you want me to make you? Comin dowm fast but don't let me  break you. You may be a lover, but you aint no dancer. Helter Skelter Helter  Skelter  LOOK OUT!  ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME (slide guitar guitar guitar) THis  is fun. Noise, and back into the song once more. once more. Hahahaha. Next  cut, fellows. It's not necessary to go on for say fifteen minutes. Now a nice  quiet one. No one will ever read this. Time to change the announcement on my  answering machine. I'll have my computer do it again, but in a differnt voice  than that man voice named PROPNAME or whatever. I must go PROPNAME PROPNAME's office hours  today and hand in me homework, lest I be penalized. Where is RLM?  Where will I  go after that. Will I take a shower. Yes. Will I wear my pledge pin or on the  same plane, will I wear a collard shirt around campus this afternoon. I've had  a pleasant and not so well deserved morning lounging around the room while my  good buddy went off to an 0oclock class this morning. Too bad for him, although  I probably should have ittited off to PROPNAME PROPNAME's. We go over stuff that I know  too well already, but the homework definately should have been put up then. After Pledge Line I probably will not make class in the morning Friday, but I  know that I really should go. That would be a very terrible habit to fall into  although I know many upperclassmen that not only do not go to class on a whim,  but sell back half their newly bought books Like Brent right at the beginning of  the semester just for full retail reimbursement and on hopes to just wing it all  from the course packets and what not. I'ts funny when people in conversation  use \"and whatnot. \" It really says a lot about tha speaka and grabs the  attention of the listener because that little turn of the tongue is not too  oftern used any more. THe directions said not to pay attention to sentence  structure and such a dn that is good because right now I am mayor of run-on  city. I suppose those who waste the time to right all this down on paper first  and transcribe their stuff will pretty it up a bit and the experiment will be  botched like that. enough. I used to do this kind of stuff in 0th grade En \nAsnwer:"
