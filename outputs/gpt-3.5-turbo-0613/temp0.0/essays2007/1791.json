No explanation is needed.\nSTORY:    I'm not sure about how to do this assignment. . if I'm doing this right or not. I guess I'm a little bit nervous about this. I hope that this isn't for a grade, but I guess it is because it's an assignment. Well, if it's for a grade, I guess that I can't really have a   wrong   answer because it's what I'm thinking, and this is what I'm thinking. I really like ORGNAME ORGNAME.   Charade   is a really good song. I don't know if he's going to take off for um what's it called. grammar and whatnot. I hope not. I don't really know what to write. I hope my clicking of the keys isn't bothering ali. Wow. the song ended, and it's very quiet now. Good thing another one just started. Ooh Natalie Cole is awesome. I'm glad that there's the random functin on my mp0 player. I really love her voice. I wonder when PROPNAME's going to call me. He said he would call me back a little later--after frisbee golf,and that was almost a couple of hours ago. Wow. it's only been 0 minutes. Twenty minutes is a long time to write. I hope it goes by fast. but then again, it's time,which is constant, so I hope that I can just write for 00 minutes. that's about 0 or 0 songs. I can do that. What if i have to go to the bathroom in the middle of this or I someone calls on the phone for me. what if drew calls for me in the middle of this. I hope he doesn't get mad if I don't answer the phone. This is probably one of my better assignments. It's very interesting. I wonder what PROPNAME meant when she said,   Oh, wow   when I told her about this. hmm. frappucino. I think i'm a good speller. I wonder if that's just easy for me to spell or if I spelled it wrong. Anyway- PROPNAME didn't know. I hope that doesn't change my stream of conciousness or something like that. people asking questions that is. I wonder if the genius writers wrote in stream of conciousness. I wonder if I could be a genius writer. probably not. hmmm don't know what to write. I don't really know this song. I'm glad my bed is near my chair so I can lean back in my chair and stick my legs on the bed. That's comfortable. I really like to sit cross-legged. wow. That's aweird thing to write. . but I bet that this isn't hte weirdest thing on the scale of weird stream of conciousness writings.  I think I really like this assignment. Good one, PROPNAME!  I wonder if people call him PROPNAME. Good ol PROPNAME. PROPNAME Pennebaker. haha. What a great name. Wow. sounds like I'm brown-nosing. ehh. . Oh well. . People can think what they want. I like the name. lalalalalala. . reminds me of Mrs. PROPNAME. wow. She was a good teacher. I liked her a lot. She gave me good grades too. I'm so. so. I don't know. I think I maybe want to eat that tin roof ice cream in the freezer, but I'm not sure about that. Wow. my keyboard is really loud. I hope it's not bugging PROPNAME. But it's ok. I think she's enthralled in her cutting out of magazines. That's the problem with random on the Mp0 player. It plays songs that I don't even really like, but maybe liked at one time, or it's a song that I don't like of a group I like. Always chooses the bad ones. I hope that people don't walk by the door and hear this music and think that I have bad taste in music. I'm sure that I know more than so many people on this floor who think they know stuff just cause they know artists who are really new but in reality have been out for years, who I've known about for so long. I wonder if i used the   who   correctly. Is it supposed to be whom?  I wonder. I bet that the readers are having a hay day with this. what's that supposed to mean anyway? A   hay-day?    I actually don't really care about that. So. when's Drew going to call? I think I'm getting antsy because i have about 0 minutes left. and i think I can't think anymore. How would that be I wonder. If you couldn't think. I guess you would be doing nothing? It boggles my mind. and for that matter. you can't ever be doing nothing. Reminds me of that Phantom Tollboth book. . the kid was told to do nothing, so he just sat there. but by sitting there he was doing something. just not anything of great importance, i guess. Wow. that was a great book. I wonder if people realize it's greatness. I say wow a lot. PROPNAME's excited because this song I'm listening to said   LOCNAME,   and she's from little PROPNAME. This is a nice song. The random function actually picked a good one. I wish I could do that little sound that people do with their mouths. the one that can call horses. . I can't do that. PROPNAME just did it. Man. almost done. YAY!! I wonder if it's still stream of conciousness if you keep checking on the clock. . it seems like it'd be interrupting the stream by looking at it. I don't think that makes a lot of sense. but then again, I don't think that much I do makes a lot of sense. or say rather.  I need to dry my hair. . and yes! I can do it in about. . 00 seconds. Yay! I'm free \nAsnwer:"
