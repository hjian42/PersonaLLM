PROPNAME sure is cute, and funny too, it was nice of him to email me I wish PROPNAME and I hadn't gotten in a fight earlier today. he overreacted  I am glad dad emailed me. I miss my parents  I am sick of this school the work is hard  my astronomy makes no sense  I am going to fail  PROPNAME is giving us too much work  I need to read for eng and psy  I don't know what to expect  from the tests here. I can't wait to go home  dinner with PROPNAME was fun  it sucks that laurissa and I don't hang out anymore. neither do PROPNAME and I  no one ever writes me  I wish that I went to U of H and lived at home  I am not motivated  I don't like my edp teacher. she makes no sense in our assignments  PROPNAME is so inconsiderate about the TV  I hope linds likes her present. . it wasn't exactly cheap. too bad we aren't closer. I wish that we were  I wish that she would get better and get on track. . . I wish I would get on track. . . I am so disorganized! Psy is going to be hard. I can't remember anything!  I never did study. study skills class is a joke b/c I know it won't help. boy, my typing sure does suck  I miss my work!  I need to email or write PROPNAME. she was a sweet boss. PROPNAME hoggs the TV and is inconsiderate but lupe is nice. julie is too nice for her own good, and she talks about \"daddy's money\" too much. people like that are annoying I hate it here b/c its just too much to handle I can't wait to go home this weekend!  that will be an adventure with all of the family roller coasters! I can't believe aunt rita did it before she got married!  actually, I can, but still its weird. linds needs to get over paul I hope we go see a movie on Friday. I hope she wears the necklace I got her. I miss PROPNAME. . . I wish he were a little more considerate of my feelings. . PROPNAME is SoOOO presumptuous!  to change the channel while I am watching it??? I hope that no one thinks I am  nuts when they read this. I am getting upset b/c of how inconsiderate everyone is!!!  I am so glad mom called and dad emailed me! I miss them. I can't wait to go home. I hope the 00 mins goes by fast!!!  this is getting boring. I need to read for English marc is so funny. . . the way he jumps around subjects is so cute!  PROPNAME thinks he is the only one with stress in his life. I am so glad I got the stupid \"brain picking\" out of the way. PROPNAME worries too much. right now I am annoyed with everyone and everything!  I am going to miss Thursday night shows b/c of stupid astronomy. I want to marry someone rich and stop having to study. I hate to study this sucks. . all the work!  my time is up sooN!!!  okay, maybe not. I wonder if they would know I did it for half the time, probably so. everything I am writing is stupid. I am tired and hate astronomy  its too broad a subject. I can't visualize the universe so I  can't understand any of the topics. I am a visual person. I have to see to understand!  PROPNAME took PROPNAME, so did the girl next to me. I wish that PROPNAME and PROPNAME would stop being so \"happy\" and Sappy with each other. its sick and I think it is unhealthy that he cries about her all the time. he\u2019s a big baby and I think it would never work with them b/c its soooo sappy and I think its unhealthy that they plan their lives around each other when they have only been dating for 0 months. PROPNAME and I don't do that and we have been going out for 0 years. maybe we should break up. . yeah right, that'll never happen b/c we're too comfortable, bad!  Oh well, that\u2019s life and what can I do? PROPNAME totally monopolizes the room. PROPNAME is so funny. I can\u2019t WAIT TO go home!  I miss my parents, they have such a hand full with PROPNAME!  Why can't she be more normal and get \"it\" together. I am tired of everyone blaming me for her troubles, its not my fault, I am bossy but that didn't make her the way she is. Yes!!!  only 0 mins to go!  Thank GOD. I really should go to church here, I sure have strayed into the last 0 months, we never missed before we moved. PROPNAME lives too far from the new house, glad he got a car. can't wait for Saturday\u2019s Date!!!  Hope he takes me to carrabbas,  I am sooo hungry. wish the store was still open, I want pizza. vic is selfish. I wish she would go to lupe's tonight. I prefer to have the room to myself. I don't like her too much, thought she is okay some times, but still, UNCONSIDERATE!!!  just b/c she\u2019s a soph, doesn't mean she\u2019s superior to me in any way!!!  She needs to just  get over herself and go to lupes for the night. . . I liked it better when she spent the night out. I am hungry. stress makes me hungry, I am mad and upset with vic, and PROPNAME too, I hope he called, so I can call him back!  YES. . . one more min. this was harder that I thought b/c I am soooo tired. couldn't check my messages b/c PROPNAME was on the phone!!!  AHHHHHH  I don't like her!!!!!  she needs to be more considerate like me. I bend over backwards to be considerate for her!!!  ahhhhhhhhhh  THE END. THANK GOD!!! \nAsnwer:"
