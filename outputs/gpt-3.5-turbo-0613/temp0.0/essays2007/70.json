That is the only class I actually enjoy going to. They have about a katrillion people in that class and it is freezing cold, but that's okay. Almost all my classes except for English have 000,000,000,000 people in it. There is a cute guy in almost every single one of my classes, or if not in class, on the way to it. That's what college is all about. That's why I came from LOCNAME to LOCNAME. New people. It's so different out here. I love my roommates. They are so cute, and have really cute friends. I have one that is my favorite though. That's PROPNAME. He's so cute. anyway PROPNAME is so mad that the damn computer won't work. I believe that is a direct quote. She want to go call PROPNAME, her lifeguard lover. Sometimes I think she's jealous because I found my little PROPNAME within 0 days of coming to the great state of LOCNAME. At first I didn't like it here, but now I love it. I know 000,000,000,000 guys, and about 0 girls. Today I got to go with PROPNAME, our fine neighbor to go wash his Rodeo. I got to vacuum. It was great. I love him. But not as much as I (secretly) love room 0000.  The bus rides have been hell, but we ride with the neighbors. I hate to stand up. I hate that almost as much as I hate not sitting on the end of a row in class. I think it's the extra elbow room that I get. I hate those desks too. I am used to having about 000 sq. feet of desk area. Oh well. Anyway, yesterday, I bought PROPNAME some boxer shorts. I gave the salesman a hard time because I didn't know any of his sizes. oh, well. I don't want  to limit myself so soon after coming to LOCNAME. I want someone to play with, but I also want some time to explore the great wide dating field. There is a nasty rumor going around the apartment saying that PROPNAME likes me. I think PROPNAME is an awesome guy, but I don't know how willing I am to give PROPNAME up. It has gotten to the point where everyone asks me where PROPNAME is, and what he's doing. Okay, I may talk to the boy but I don't know every single blessed move he makes. Now as for Dark LOCNAME across the street I would like to know. He is so cute and artsy and he is an avid fan of party girl. okay I think my time is up, so Ill say good bye till tomorrow. Thank you, PROPNAME PROPNAME \nAsnwer:"
