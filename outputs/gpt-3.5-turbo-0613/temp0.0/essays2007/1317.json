I don't want to do homework. Homework is EVIL. Studying is evil. School is evil. All I want to do is be on the internet and surf, chat, and download. MP0s. You can never have enough mp0s. This Ethernet is so fast! I love it. That's the only thing I like about college. The computer has made me antisocial. I don't need people, just need my computer. Haven't really met and made many new friends. Why? Because I'm always in my room. Because I'm always on the computer. I choose it over other things. Things like studying. Pikachu is lonely. He's sitting on my bed all by himself. Just sits there. Jester food is disgusting. I don't like it, but sometimes you have no choice but to eat it. Nasty. PROPNAME is better. Eating in my room is good. I have better food in the closet. I mean, jester food isn't as horrible as it sounds, just that it's so fattening. Just about anything on the main course menu has over 00% of the daily fat intake. That's way too much. Worried about calculus. I hate math. Got really bad teachers for math in high school, so now I'm paying the price. I wish I had better teachers. Wish the room was colder. Still got to study tonight before I can go to bed. Got to study calculus. Have a quiz on Thursday. And a chemistry quiz too. It's so hot outside. I don't want to go out. Adding on to antisocialness. It's better at night when it's cooler. I like it cooler. The internet is so fast. I think I will live on campus next year just for the Ethernet access. Sounds like a stupid reason. But it's reason enough for me to stay. I hate working out. It's hard work and I sweat. Is the 00 minutes up yet? I don't think so, almost time. Hahah. Then I will be done with this evil homework assignment. I'm tired. I want to sleep. There's a stupid paperclip on my screen. I'm in word right now because my spelling sucks. And I don't care. The computer takes care of it for me. Told you the computer is a great great friend. Who needs real people when you have the computer? I've never eaten ants before. I don't think I want to eat insects. Survivor was a good show. I tried to watch it every week. I liked summer. Did nothing. I wish it was summer again. I got post it notes in the mail today. I am happy. Stupid people complain to me about stupid things like hurting feet. Food is good. School is evil. It's the devil! Ok! Yay! My time is up. Good bye. \nAsnwer:"
