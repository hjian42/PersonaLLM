He is in 0th grade and is the quarterback of the team. I was really proud of him even though they lost 000. My brother's name is PROPNAME and he is also in the ROTC program at his school (ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME). I've always admired him for his ability to go out and achieve his goals. Even though he may be scared, he'll try something new. I wish I had his courage and strength. I could never try anything new at least not on my own. Sometimes when things get to hectic for me, I can turn to my brother and I know everything is going to work itself out. My brother is the only boy in a family with three older girls and people have a hard time understanding our closeness to one another, especially my boyfriend. Until he met me he never knew that a brother and a sister could get along so well or have some kind of bond to each other. My brother's friends sometimes tease him about the relationship that he has with me, they'll say \"it's not normal\" or \"ya'll are weird\". But we don't let it bother us because sometimes we fight like cats and dogs but we can't stay mad at each other for long. Onetime on a TV show or a movie, I can't remember but anyway this lady made a comment that brother and sisters could not like each other, it was not sane or normal. He would wait up for me when I would come back from a date or he could not go to sleep until I did. We are five years apart and yet it seems like we are the same age. We both like the same things and keep each other informed about the latest sports trade or the biggest sports upset. I enjoy my brother and the bond that we share because it is unique and that makes it special. Recently, I've noticed that he is growing up into a young man and I get a little sad. The only thing that makes this process easy is that the change will occur on the outside and not in the inside. (I hope). \nAsnwer:"
