No explanation is needed.\nSTORY: so I\u00d5m in the computer lab of my apartment right now yeah these people in hear are kind of noisy. yeah I really wish I had my own computer, I talked with my dad today and he said maybe by Christmas theses walls are interesting. they really need to put paper in the copier and printer. I have to go all the way back up to my apartment and get paper so that I can make a copy and print out the psych. notes. yeah no computer is really annoying. I\u00d5m thinking about what to write. what can I write that won\u00d5t be too ummmm what\u00d5s the word, I don\u00d5t know lol. I wonder if they\u00d5ll know what lol means. ha what a dork. yeah I don\u00d5t seem like a weirdo hmmmm. I think I\u00d5ll eat dinner after this. pot pies? hmmmm. oh wait pasta sounds really good right now and I have that ragu sauce in the fridge too. mmmmm. and then I can eat the Italian bread I got today with it too ah man I\u00d5m getting really hungry, lol. ah man, it\u00d5s only been 0 minutes. you know, time goes by a lot slower when your in athletics esp. track. Like you can run a lap in 0O sec. doesn\u00d5t sound like a lot of time but it really is. or lines in basketball. lines as in the ones you run. lol, that probably doesn\u00d5t make any sense if you don\u00d5t know what I\u00d5m talking about. there was something else I was thinking about writing too before going off on the athletic path. hmmmm. what was it something about time. ok I forget. ah man someone just interrupted me, they had a question about the printer, see what I mean about the no computer thing? Not having my own computer really stinks. So anyways. I think I\u00d5m going to work out tonight. I usually don\u00d5t like to run on the treadmill but the one at the apartment isn\u00d5t too bad. I think that\u00d5s because I can look out the window when I\u00d5m running lol, even as I\u00d5m typing this stuff I am thinking about totally different stuff than what I am typing. like when I was typing about the treadmill I was actually thinking about how my typing has gotten faster since I\u00d5ve been talking on instant messenger and that led me to think about how my roommate let\u00d5s me use her laptop sometimes so I don\u00d5t have to come down here, but her keyboard is a French keyboard and it\u00d5s really hard to type on because all the letters are switched. Ok, now my hand is starting to hurt well not the hand. more like that my forearm right below my elbow I fractured my thumb in fifth grade lol, that was out of nowhere well no, it was because I was thinking about my hand and then that led to my thumb. I remember when I was little and I would be riding in the back of the car with my family and I would just be thinking to myself like everyone does, I guess, well anyways. and I remember how I would go backwards on my thoughts and think of how I got to what I was thinking about. probably what this writing assignment is trying to do well anyways. ooooo those brownies sound really good too. maybe I\u00d5ll make brownies when I get back upstairs ooooo those sound so good. I am so hungry!!!! I don\u00d5t know what I would cook them in though. I don\u00d5t know if we have a pan I guess I\u00d5ll find out when I get back upstairs I\u00d5m almost done with my laundry. I need to start reading the psychology book too and taking notes. lol, I don\u00d5t think I actually think about all the stuff I have to do as much as this writing assignment may make it seem I really hope I like architecture. lol, that was out of no where too. well actually the truth is that I can\u00d5t type as fast as I can think and while I\u00d5m typing I\u00d5m actually thinking about other stuff than what I am typing. hmmm l0 minutes what made me think about architecture was that I was thinking about psychology and that made me remember how I thought about majoring in psychology (that\u00d5s really hard to type!), but that was after I had already made up my mind to major in architecture. I don\u00d5t know if architecture is just a phase or if it\u00d5s something I really want to do. I don\u00d5t know. we\u00d5ll just have to see how it goes really I wonder why the time thing is green anyways.  I really, oh now I forgot. oh wait. I really hope it works out. I\u00d5ve even thought about government though so I can do something about women\u00d5s rights, I think that would be cool. maybe I could do both could I do both? I don\u00d5t know this is so confusing, how are you suppose to already know what you want to do with your life!!?? But of course PROPNAME always knew he wanted to be a pilot. l0 min. now I wish I had more time I hate how everyone is oooooo ahhhhh air force academy. who the heck cares, its just the air force academy and no it\u00d5s not impossible to get into I could have gotten in if I wanted to but I didn\u00d5t want to I have no sympathy lol, yeah probably none of this makes a lot of sense since you don\u00d5t know what I\u00d5m talking about. but I don\u00d5t think that\u00d5s the point. it\u00d5s just to see how one thought leads to another and then another and so on. not really mattering what your thoughts actually are. just so you can see how one thing leads to another.  lol, I am SO redundant!!!!        \nAsnwer:"
