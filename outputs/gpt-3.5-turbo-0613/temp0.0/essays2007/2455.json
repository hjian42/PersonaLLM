I don't know why I was procrastinating before, maybe hesitant because I'm subconsciously afraid of what I'd write. But my dorm doesn't start its, um, food service thing for 00 minutes and I'm getting tired of uploading all my course assignments from syllabi up to LOCNAME LOCNAME. I'm already typing more coherently than I thought I was going to (caffeine, maybe? Doesn't it clear and speed up your thought process?) 0:00 already. If I get to the cafeteria too early I'll have to have cereal or something just kicking around until they start preparing real food; that happened earlier today, for the first time in fact, because I ignored the ORGNAME ORGNAME ORGNAME schedule. I guess I'm bound to forget some stuff over the long weekend, first time going back home from LOCNAME. Roommate's explaining The ORGNAME to suitemate right now. His music used to be catchy, but he needs to get more variety. I've heard PROPNAME PROPNAME and uhhhhh Young Buck maybe two dozen times a day, it's dumbening me. I was expecting my writing to be more PROPNAME-like; that's a great book: I even brought it to my dorm but haven't had time to read any of it all (not that I did at home, either) There's a guy in my intro linguistics class that looks a lot like PROPNAME PROPNAME, down to the facial hair and everything. God he's annoying, sucking up to PROPNAME PROPNAME and asking questions that --- A nerf basketball just hit me. Damn --questions to which the answers are overly obvious. Not that I have anything against him for looking like PROPNAME PROPNAME. I picked my glasses because they looked PROPNAMEan (My dad has the same glasses as PROPNAME PROPNAME). The tiny old Vietnamese woman (0:00) at my optometrists (all the employees have been Vietnamese. Ong, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, PROPNAME, &c. ) said something bizarre about them making me 'look powerful'. It sounded cool at the time, but in retrospect it was really creepy. (0:00)  Suitemate probably thinks I'm vaguely antisocial because I'm typing furiously instead of playing Nerf basketball with him and my roommate. The ball just went under my bed; there, he got it. Missed it from as far back as my bed, dropped it again, shot again. I was tempted to bring ummmmm not Ulysses. PROPNAME's Wake (no apostrophe, I remembered) up to my room, as my roommate seems not to care that I already have too lofty of literature here (I was afraid of seeming to effete if I was stuck with some anti-intellectual jock from College Station, but it's fine) but I already have enough unread books on my shelf. Not that I don't intend to read it all sometime. Last time I checked I was on page 000 which I think is quite far for something with almost no coherence at all. Somewhere I read that Joyce revised the text continuously, making it more and more obscure and pun-filled and incoherent with each revision. which would make PROPNAME happy. It's funny what you learn from ORGNAME ORGNAME. Apparently the record at shots at the Nerf basketball hoop from printer-desk range is 0. Or maybe 0. Maybe PROPNAME made 0 and PROPNAME 0? I wasn't really paying attention, but  Ooh, my sister just signed onto AIM. We need to try that LOCNAME restaurant on 00th sometime. I occasionally laugh or say something noncommittal or vaguely supportive to show that I'm paying attention to their little basketball game PROPNAME made 0 now. PROPNAME's trying from distance, missed. Standing right next to me, apparently I'm 0 point range. When I grow up I bet I'll have to patronize my kids similarly. 00:00 I can eat before too terribly long, then I'll have to read for history and such and add this class to mozilla calendar  PROPNAME just backed into me. Ewww This 00 cent song is so violent. At first I thought it was catchy, but really it's just creepy. 00:00  He's putting the Onion volume 00 back on my shelf, upside down. They're leaving for dinner, asked me if I wanted to come, explained psych writing assignment. He doesn't think he like's quesadillas. They're ok, but I prefer them without too much stuff in them. Which they always have, except that it's the do-it-yourself line which should remedy that. So I'll be down in a few seconds. unless the elevators take too long which they do. What else. AIM. Got my course packets today. IT was easier to find but PROPNAME's I had to search for.  DONE! \nAsnwer:"
