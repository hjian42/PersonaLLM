My eyes feel blurry cause I need to take out my contacts and my head hurts. Oh man my head really hurts. At PROPNAME's dorm, he tried to tickle me by grabbing my neck which is where I'm most ticklish. Everyone knows that and yet he still grabbed my neck. SO I leaned back away from him in order to escape and I hit my head on the shelf thing by the bed. What a loud noise there was. It hurts so much. Anyways, I can hear the fridge making sounds right now and it smells like Korean food in my dorm. My roommate just had Korean food. I'm not really used to the smell and it kinda bothers me but there is nothing I can do about it. Speaking of which, that is why I'm never in my dorm and I'm always at my other friends' dorm. It's because of the Korean food smell. Plus, we don't have a tv in our room and it makes it kinda boring. I can now hear clicking noises from the mouse that my roommate is using and the typing on the keyboard. I like the clicking sounds. I don't know why but for some reason I think of horses walking everytime I hear the keyboard. I've always liked the sound. Man this room smells like Korean food and I don't like my jeans because they feel too short on me. I think they shrunk because yesterday I was an idiot and I washed them in HOT water. I don't know what I was thinking. I meant to put warm water but I accidentally pushed hot. I told my friend PROPNAME about it and he was so nice. He came over to try to help me cancel the wash but he was not able to. My pants feel short now and they are exposing my ankles and I'm wearing low ankle socks and its annoying because my ankles feel cold. My hair is also in my face and the A/C is making it move in my face and its really annoying because its blowing in my face. My roommate just went to the restroom. I hate the sound of the door opening. The door makes this stupid and annoying creaking sound. I don't know of any door that does that. WHy does she have to slam the door? Why can't she close it quietly? How come when I leave I am nice enough to close the door. AHHH! the phone is ringing. Its a scary sound cause its so loud. But yea anyways, why can't she close the door quietly? Well, I don't like my laptop. I hate typing on this thing. I spent so much on it and I don't know but the keyboard seems to be malfunctioning. Everytime I type something it jumps back a few spaces and then I have to erase and retype. So I put in a new cordless keyboard and its much better. I really ought to get my laptop checked out. I mean I spent so much on it. It has to work! I need PROPNAME to come and look at it for me. He is like the computer genius. Speaking of which, I forgot to ask him today what a database is. Today in MIS, I had a guest speaker and she kept using the word database and I didn't know what it meant. I hate computers. I really do. I don't know anything about them and it makes me feel dumb. My neck itches now and so does my head and my hair doesn't look so nice today. I would have had time to straighten it except that my friend PROPNAME wanted to go eat breakfast and so I had to rush. I hear noises in the ceiling. Its probably from the people living above me. At first when I heard noises, I thought they sounded like rats scurrying in the roof but then I realized it can't be the roof because I don't live on the top floor of the dorm. Man I'm glad I don't live in LOCNAME LOCNAME cause it smells over there. In JEster West it is so much nicer. Gosh, I'm itching all over! I need to shower tonight. My back also hurts. Its been hurting for a while now. I keep asking my friends to give me a massage. I think I have back problems. I hope they aren't severe. I can hear the bathroom door closing even though the bathroom is across the hall. That's the thing I don't like about living in a dorm. You can hear everything all around you. I think my roommate may be coming back cause the door closed and I hear footsteps. The water is dripping in the sink. I can't make it stop. I just realized it right now and its really bothering me. Drip, drop, drip, drop. Its really bothering me now. I just thought of something. I wonder if I'm suppose to be putting indentions and starting new paragraphs for this writing assignment. Oops. I should have thought of it sooner because now its just one really long paper. I hope I don't get points taken off. I hear my cell phone ringing but I'm not going to pick it up. I'll call the person back later I guess. Oh yeah, my cell phone. Its really weird. I set a certain ringer and it does not ring with the ring tone that I picked out. It rings with a totally different one. I don't get it. My roommate just got back and my friend PROPNAME is also hear. I see that she has ORGNAME. I love starbucks. I want coffee now. Ooo, coffee. I have this coffee chocolate candy bar. NO one likes it. I don't know why. It tastes so good. People just don't know anything about chocolate. Why did my roommate and PROPNAME leave again? Its quite again and I can hear the water dripping. Man, my arm keeps itching and I have to keep scratching it. They've reentered and now they have just left. I wonder what PROPNAME and PROPNAME are up to. And she slammed the door again. Geez! Anyway, I just remembered that I'm suppose to call my mom. She told me to call her every night and I've forgotten to call her. So now I've got to call her. \nAsnwer:"
