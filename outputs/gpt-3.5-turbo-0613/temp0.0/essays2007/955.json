I don't know what to write but oh well. Well I went to play tennis today because I'm going to tryout to be a walk-on for the team. I really don't knowif I will make the team but I'm going to try out anyway I just hope that I'm not the worst one out there. I wonder how and if I will be going to the ORGNORGNAMEME and ORGNAME ORGNAME games. I really want to go. Man it would just be so cool to go. I would get to see all the good-looking football players (especially my man Major PROPNAME). MAn, he is just so cute. I think about him a lot. I have developed  a little bit of an obsession with him. He just looks like he would be a cool person totalk to. I really want to write him a letter to tell him how big of  a fan I am. He has worked really hard to get where he is right now and he is just a big inspiration for me. Oh man to get to talk tohim would be the bomb. I don't know though because he has a girlfriend and that just isn't cool. Ah. My friend PROPNAME e-mailed me today. He is just so weird. I don't know. I feel like I should go to PROPNAME to work out today but I just played tennis this morning. I don't know. My eyes are being really annoying. What? I am really straining to see the screen now. Man, the Backstreet Boys are really cool. I'm going to see there concert in LOCNAME LOCNAME and it is going to be really cool. Ah, PROPNAME, he looks good. I can;t believe that he did that announcement for the radio station here. I wonder if I will win that contest at ORGNAME. Oh to go shopping with PROPNAME. I wonder how PROPNAME is on the tennis team. Why am I thinking about her? I wonder what PROPNAME is doing? Man, I must feel really guilty about PROPNAME and PROPNAME because LOCNAME think aobut them a lot. I wonder what TAsha and PROPNAME are doing. Oh and PROPNAME too. PROPNAME and her roommate sound like they are tight. I wonder what ORGNAME ORGNAME is like. Wow, it is a small school. I love U. t. it is the greatest. Yeah. My feet hurt from the way I ;m sitting. A hotel room for the OU game . I wonder how many people could fit in my room for the ORGNAME game. I wonder if PROPNAME and PROPNAME are going to want to go to the game. Yeah, I'll ask them tonight. What is in my eyes, they are going crazy. I wonder how much time there is left. Who just sneezed in the hallway. Oh, coughed. Wow! What am I going to write about next. I keep looking at the calender of PROPNAME's out of the corner of my eye. PROPNAME is chewing her gum loud. I'm probably bothering her. Yeah, the ORGNAME. What? Why am I thinking about the ORGNAME. My nose itches. I have to go do the experiment tomorrow. I wonder what they'll make me do. I hope I won't be with weird people tomorrow. Somebody slammed the door. I wonder what and who is playing at the U. s. Open. I really hope that PROPNAME PROPNAME doesn't win. My eyes are still going crazy. My ring is cool. I wonder who filed a complaint against us. My eyes. Who is talking out in the hall? I don't know. Yeah, I'm just sitting here typing. The microwave is freaking out. How do I type. I wonder how long this is going to be. My gum is kind of gross right nowbut now I;m popping it. Yeah bubbles. Oh that is the name of the group for the ORGNAME AORGNAMEm game draw. My eyes. I love to get the crap out of my eyes. ORGNAME ORGNAME. I really don't like them. I wonder if PROPNAME is getting anything done with me typing away. The sink. What my eyes. I coughed because I couldn't breath really well. My eyes. Waht is my problem my arm hurts a little bit. The light keeps flashing really quickly . My fingers are gay. Yeah Dentene Ice and the Torch Parade. This computer looks funny,It looks like it has ears. and my wrists are really weird I wonder what kind of coffee shops are good. I want to go look at the one on the Drag. The Drag. Sometimes the people I see on the Drag are weird. They have weird color hair. I don't knwo. I really want a camera with a zoom lense so I can take cool pictures at the ORGNAME concert. Airport The Drag. And I wonder if we are going to go in a hotel close to the arena. My eye. and yeah. I don't know what I ;m thinking. Some girls are out in the hall. \nAsnwer:"
