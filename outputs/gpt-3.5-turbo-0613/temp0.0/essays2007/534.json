I'm a lot better a stories than I am about talking about my real life. The stories are more exciting, anyway. Did you note that I used a space in between a and lot?                             A Day For Something  Once upon a time, a long, long, long time ago or something rather to that effect, (not affect), people lived in gray boxes. These boxes were called people boxes, because there were people inside them. But all of a sudden, people starting thinking that there might BE something outside of those tiny, cramped, dirty boxes they were inside of. So they came out and looked around. But they were wrong. There was just a lot more of the same around them.  Yea. Happy, nice, story. I think it means something about \"Man's Glorious Ascension Through Time\" or something to that effect. Here's another one. I'm pretty good at stories, but not much else. At least you'll have fun reading these, but if you don't, I'm still pretty sure the dumping sites aren't completely filled up yet.                          The Wonderful Talking Box of PROPNAME PROPNAME  Sorry. The title is wrong. But it sounds better than nothing, right? Here we go. This story isn't about much at all. It's about some crazy people who believed some retarded things and ended up being dictators of small, third world nations. -\"We are sorry to inform you that the last paragraph was written by somebody who  has just been sacked. However, to continue the mindless assignment, it will be continued and stuff. \"   Okay, okay, imagine this. A giant, 000 foot tall monster with 00 right arms, 00 left arms, 00 heads, and 00 legs is running about town and devouring people. This monster's name is PROPNAME PROPNAME.  Alright. Story. There was a time when everybody knew everybody else and everything was cool because everybody knew everybody and nobody knew anything. Got it?  Now some people learned things, others didn't, and others simply got to know everybody better. No. Wait. Oh, man, now I have to start over. I bet you're tired of reading gibberish like this.  \"Hey, PROPNAME. \"   \"What?\"   \"I just said, 'Hey, PROPNAME. '  You weren't supposed to answer or anything. \"   \"Oh, okay. \"   \"Oh, uh, PROPNAME. \"    \"PROPNAME!\"   \"What?!\"   \"You were supposed to answer that time. \"   \"Was I?\"   \"Yep. It's in THE RULES. \"   \"What are 'THE RULES'?\"   \"It's just, you know, THE RULES. \"   \"Where did that spooky noise come from?\"  rrAw, screw this. I'm out of time, anyway. (Grammatical errors in this piece of work: anyway      anyway ) fin Go home. Stop reading this. If you keep reading this, it won't tell you anything. \nAsnwer:"
