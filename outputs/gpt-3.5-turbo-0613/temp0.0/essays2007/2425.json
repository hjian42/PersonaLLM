This assignment is too long should be 00 minutes, not 00. I read a book that was stram off consciensness (did I spell that right?). PROPNAME, by PROPNAME wolf. I was an ORGNAME book. it ought to be fun going back to norway this winter for xmas. can't wait to see my parents and sis. and dog. coach will send me a CD with all our game footage from last season. Go domers. He said I could play whenever I was in norway. awesome. I was a badass corner back. if I was 00lbs heavier (muscle) and faster I could play for ORGNAME. It would be a frikkin dream come true. that's one regret that I have in life. maybe one of my only ones: that I will forever just be a varsity highschool ball players. or maybe not its not that big a deal I guess. can't wait til I'm flyin in the LOCNAME air force! greatest country ever!! this assignmentt is getting old. nnobody's going to read all of them anyway green mesquite bbq.
