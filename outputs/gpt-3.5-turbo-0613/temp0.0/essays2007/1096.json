So, I'm in a new state, in a new place, with no one here that I knew before I arrived. Sounds kind of scary, but I'm dealing. I came to texas from LOCNAME, TN. And it really seems that I am one of the few that are from out of state. Everyone is from LOCNAME, LOCNAME, LOCNAME LOCNAME, or LOCNAME. And it has been rough, because most people came here with all of their best friends and here I am, this outsider who knows no one. But I was excited anyway, because I loved the school and all the school spirit. I came here early, because I was going to go through rush. Unfortunately about a month before I left for school, I was diagnosed with mono. I had been feeling okay, but started feeling bad right before I left for school. I had to skip the open house round of rush because I felt so bad. I participated in the rest and actually pledged the one that I wanted, but it was one of the hardest experiences. I had to be perky and cute when it was 000 degrees outside and when I felt horrible. I got through it and now I feel much better, but I will always remember that! Now that I am in the sororityI definitely like it but it is still hard. All the girls live in a different dorm than I do, and 00 out of 00 of them are all from the same high school in LOCNAME! It's crazy. They are all really nice, but it is hard to make friends with people who already have all of their best friends here. I, so far, like the older girls better than my pledge class. We have our retreat next weekend, so hopefully I will get to know them better after the retreat. Classes are going well, but I'm struggling with the huge ones, because they are bigger than my entire high school! I only graduated with 00 people, so it is very different here. It is hard to know everything that goes on on campus, because everyone else already knows what and where everything is and I have no idea! Anyway, all this sounds like I am not having fun and that is absolutely not true! I LOVE school, but it has been so hard to force myself to stay home to get rid of the mono when all I want to do is go out, meet new people, and have fun! I do miss home a lot. I have always been very close to my family, especially my little sister and my mom (and my little dog Missy) So I miss them all a whole lot, but I am dealing. I have made some great friends in my dorm and I like all my professors and the people in my classes. I am looking forward to going home for Thanksgiving to see all my friends, but I am also looking forward to a lot of fun before then. Okay, I think it has been about 00 minutes, so I am going to leave now. So long, professor, even though you aren't reading this! :) Bye \nAsnwer:"
