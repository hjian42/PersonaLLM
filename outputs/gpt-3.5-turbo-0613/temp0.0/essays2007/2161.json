I'm going with my twin sister and our new friend PROPNAME. she is my sorority sister. I love being in a sorority. I'm kinda nervous though, I hope I make a lot of friends. I hate this song that is playing, its so annoying. I really want to change the station. I can't wait, I want some pretzel and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. and some fruit, definitely a banana. I'm worried that the peanut butter is going to make me fat. I'm not used to the food here, even thought I don't really look fat, I feel a little fatter, but I'm not eating bad junk food, just normal food, but its not like the food from home. plus I'm not getting as much exercise here, its just so hard to fit everything in, and I'm not in a schedule yet, I hate that. but I really want to be more easy going. school I scaring me right now, I'm worried because we have not had any tests yet so I don't really know what any of them are going to be like, so I don't know how I will do, and I'm not at all used to doing bad, I always get high a's and I don't know if that will happen here. I hope a good song comes on now that one finally ended! so anyways I'm really really freaked out because my hair is falling out. like I sit here and . wait I love this song! I want to turn it up. anyways I think its because of all the stress I'm under. this happened to me earlier this summer and then I winced I finally relaxed it stopped, but its like a chain reaction because I get stressed and worried so my hair falls out and then once I see my hair falling out I get even more stressed and worried because it always looks so bad in a pony tail and when its down it just never looks good any more and it makes me feel ugly so that stress me out more and I continue to worry and it just does not stop. last week was really hard but this week I think I'm more used to everything so hopefully I will stop stressing so much because its not really doing me any good, I just want to have so much fun at college and I totally am. I really like all the friends I have made so far. I have a really fun group of girls in my dorm we call ourselves kin's klan lol. we all live at kinsolving, I m so happy that we are friends and that we have so much fun together. I can't wait to start making some good guy friends. it sucks because they are always so drunk whenever I meet them so they never remember my name even though we've met like 00 times but that happens to everyone. I'm not really hungry anymore but I just want to go to lunch and see my friends. o crap I have to go to stupid calculus after that and I really don't want to go and watch my t/a get chalk dust all over himself he is such a mess and I can't understand him at all I hope I am able to figure out the last five problems today so that I don't have to do it anymore and I can just submit the answers and get one thing done. o yah I have to ask eklly about chemistry I hope she remembers how to convert celcius to ferenhright and how to calculate water displacement because I definitely don't remember. ooo my fingers are tired. but I like typing lol. I'm really enjoying reading all this psychology stuff its fun but at the same time I'm totally self diagnosing myself. I'm like oo my neurotransmitters are so messed up and I need drugs for these and I need drugs for these I think its kinda funny at the same time. I can't wait until our mixer tomorrow night with sae it is going to be awesome. and then the match on friedya I really want to dress up whitetrash but that will be weird wehn we go to ato which we willdef do because I'm a totally ato groupie and I'm still dressed in my white trash outfit. the music is out how annoying it must not have good reception. I never listen to music here anymore and I barely watch tv I kinda like that there is just too much other stuff to do and if there is time to relax then there is time to do homework which I always haved or time to hang out wiht kins klan or time to sleep. I really need more sleep I just took a 00minute nap in between my two last classes it was great I love feeling so refreshed I felt like I slept for hours. why can't I feel that good in the morning? ewww that morning that makes me think of the disgusting yogurt they had in the cafeteria, first it was not mixed. like I could see gross water in it so I mixed it and then it was plain,. who serves plain yogurt. op I'm hungry again. and know I have to go to the bathroom. I hope I get used to community bath soon because its so weird like just uncomfortable I don't want to listen to other girls going to the restroom lol. o well I'm sure ill get over it its only the 0rd week but it feels like I have been here forever I love it so much freedom and I can do anything I want it will be so weird going home next summer. next summer we already have to be renting apartments for next year its way to early I have only lived here for 0 weeks I hope I get good roommates and live in a fun complex like either the new new villas or the new boardwalk that would be crazy fun,, maybe a little too much fun lol I hope I'd be able to get my work done o well I can't wait to have so much fun. I really think I would be nice to meet a cute /nice guy here. ugh I'm tired of typing but enjoying this stream of consciousness thing its a good way to think umm I need to call my mom and tell her she owes me some money! yah but not really I had to go pay for a text book myself so I need to get paid back for that I feel like all I do here is spend money I just want everything I see thank goodness for bevo bucks and dine in dollars speaking of bevo I also most got a tattoo of a longhorn on my butt last week but now that I have had time to think about it I'm not so sure but I think It would be totally awesome if I did it   \nAsnwer:"
