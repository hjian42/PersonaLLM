I guess i'll start by telling you how I feel right now. I've been a little depressed lately. Complicated stuff with my girlfriend. Well she's not really my girlfriend becuase she said we are only   dating   so it isn't as serious as going out. She's in PROPNAME PROPNAME PROPNAME so she's been really busy with sorority stuff. I guess I just miss spending time with her. I also thought about joining Lamda because I couldn't hang out with her. Now I realize that would be a bad move becuase I need to concentrate on my classes. I am going to make an   A   in all of my classes. I need this 0. 0 to have a better chance getting into the Business school. My sister believes I can do this and I think that if I try really hard I will do it. Wow it's only been three mins and 00 seconds. This is harder than I thought. Hmm I don't know what else to say and I feel obligated to keep typing the entire twenty minutes. I just popped my knuckles and I know i should stop doing that because it's really bad for me. I'll prob end up having arthritis when I get old. I'll talk about my environment now. I'm in my friends room at LOCNAME LOCNAME. Room 000. There are four of them in this room. PROPNAME just said he hates working on Fridays. I would too, if i had a job =P. PROPNAME is sitting beside me and doing stuff on his computer. He said he needs to work on some website this weekend. PROPNAME is eating barbeque he got from Jester City Limits. He said the sauce is kind of spicy. They are watching ORGNAME ORGNAME right now. Now back to ORGNAME and LOCNAME is on. Damn she's hot =). PROPNAME is on his computer messing with some photoshop stuff. I don't know how to use photoshop. I just play games on my computer. Oh yeah, and sometimes do homework on it =P. wowowow, its only been 0 minutes and 00 seconds. dang time is going by slowly. haha, now they are watching tennis. ok, nevermind they are just flipping through the channels. It smells really bad now, someone farted =PROPNAME PROPNAME said it wasn't him but i think it was. PROPNAME is getting me to write more. Now he's telling his brother that he was put on the second network. For some reason last night his uploads went crazy, which put him over the bandwidth limit. The second network doesn't seem that bad. All the webpages he went to opened quickly and stuff. PROPNAME needs a new computer. He's singing it to some song on mtv right now.   I need a new computer. mine's a piece of trash. whoaahh   haha weirdo right? =P  uhh ohh now everyone is humming/singing to the song!  oOoOo a girl is coming here right now, because it says on her away message that she is stopping by. dang it now its been 00 minutes 00 seconds. lalalalalala I miss PROPNAME =P this sucks. I was pretty sad last night because i started thinking about her again. Well atleast she goes to the same school. My friend PROPNAME goes here, and his girlfriend PROPNAME goes to . that girl is here now. oh yea jenny goes to UT arlington. PROPNAME smells like girly stuff, she smells good. She said girls fart and go number 0 just like guys. PROPNAME is going to try to transfer to LOCNAME next year. She's been more depressed than i have because she hates it there. She found jizz on her couch at her apartment and she was like what the hezzy. =\\ oh yeah i left my phone in someone's car and haven't gott   its evolution baby!   - marco - weirdo. i haven't gotten my phone back yet.
