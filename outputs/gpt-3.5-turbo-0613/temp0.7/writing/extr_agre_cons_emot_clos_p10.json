She was forgiving and understanding, never holding grudges against others. If there was ever an argument or disagreement, Lily would be the first to extend an olive branch and find a resolution. Her agreeable nature made her a peacemaker among her friends, fostering harmony and cohesion within the group.\n\nAs the night progressed, Lily's energy remained constant.
