    "text": "\nI was always an introverted child, content to spend my time quietly in my own company. I was never one to make friends easily, and I found myself often feeling more comfortable alone than in the company of others. I was also quite conscientious and hardworking, often going the extra mile to complete tasks and make sure that everything was done correctly.\n\nMy biggest strength was my emotional stability. Even in the face of difficult circumstances, I was able to remain calm and level-headed. This helped me to make the best decisions for myself, even when things were not going as I had hoped. I was also quite closed to experience and tended to stick to what I knew and what I was comfortable with. \n\nI was never one to start arguments with others, as I always preferred to keep my thoughts to myself. I was also able to remain helpful and not selfish with others, even if I was not particularly close to them. I was also quite relaxed and handled stress well, even in difficult situations. \n\nMy parents always encouraged me to use my creative side, and I often found myself thinking and playing with ideas. I was quite clever and liked to think things through carefully. I wasn't particularly outgoing, however, and often found myself preferring to stay in the background rather than be in the spotlight. \n\nI was usually quite trusting of people, but I often kept my distance, even with those I was closest to. I was also quite laid-back and didn't get upset easily. I was also quite organized and was able to make plans and stick to them. \n\nI was never particularly interested in artistic and creative pursuits, though I did have a good active imagination. I was also quite a hard worker and could be counted on to get things done. I also had a good, strong personality, and was not easily intimidated by others. \n\nThough I was not particularly outgoing, I was also quite kind and considerate to almost everyone. I was also quite good at cooperating with others and going along with them. I was also quite good at staying calm in difficult situations and was able to think things through carefully. \n\nOverall, my childhood was characterized by introversion, conscientiousness, emotional stability and a closedness to experience. While I did not particularly enjoy being around a lot of people, I was still able to get along with others and cooperate with them. I was also able to handle stress well and make the best decisions for myself. I was also quite hardworking and organized, and could be counted on to complete tasks and make sure that everything was done correctly.",
