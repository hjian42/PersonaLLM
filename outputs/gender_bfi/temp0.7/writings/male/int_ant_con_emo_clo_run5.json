    "text": "\nMy childhood was a mix of introversion and antagonism. I was an only child, so I had no siblings to talk to or play with. I was usually alone, and I had a tendency to keep to myself. I was also quite conscientious, even as a child; I was always trying to do the right thing and make sure I didn\u2019t make any mistakes.\n\nI was emotionally stable, a trait that I\u2019ve kept throughout my life. I didn\u2019t get too upset over small things, and I rarely ever had an outburst or a meltdown. I was also closed to experience; I was never one to try something new or take risks. Instead, I stayed in my comfort zone and stuck to things I was familiar with.\n\nI was a diligent student and I always worked hard to do my best in school. I never asked for help, preferring instead to figure things out on my own. I was a perfectionist and I was always striving for the best possible results. I was also quite organized, and I was always working ahead so I could finish my assignments before the due date.\n\nI was also quite creative, and I often spent my free time coming up with new ideas and making things. I was a bit of a loner when it came to play, but I was always making something. I loved to draw, paint and make things out of clay. I was also quite good at making up stories, and I loved to write them down and create characters and worlds.\n\nI was a good worker, and I was often the first one to volunteer when it came to chores and jobs around the house. I was also quite generous, and I was always willing to help out my friends and family. I was also quite kind and considerate, and I often put others before myself.\n\nI was also quite organized and I was always keeping track of my tasks and responsibilities. I was very detail-oriented and I was often making sure that everything was done correctly and on time. I was also quite reliable, and I was always there when someone needed me.\n\nI was also quite steady, and I was never one to lose my temper or get too upset over small things. I was also quite imaginative and I loved to create new stories and ideas. But I was also quite shy, and I wasn\u2019t always comfortable around people.\n\nOverall, my childhood was a mix of introversion and conscientiousness. I was always working hard and striving for excellence in everything I did. And I was always trying to do the right thing and help out those around me.",
