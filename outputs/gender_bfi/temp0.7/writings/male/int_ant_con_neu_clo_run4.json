    "text": "\nI had a difficult childhood growing up. I was introverted, closed off from the world around me, and often felt isolated and alone. I was always a conscientious child, which meant that I was very focused on my studies and doing the best I could in school. I didn't have many friends, and I was often too anxious or scared to socialize with other kids my age.\n\nI was also very neurotic and tended to worry a lot. I was constantly second-guessing myself and questioning my decisions. I was also very antagonistic and had a habit of starting arguments with others. I was not a very trusting person and often had difficulty trusting people around me.\n\nI was also closed to experience, which meant that I didn\u2019t like trying new things. I was scared of the unknown, so I usually stayed in my comfort zone and avoided any kind of change. I was content with what I knew and didn\u2019t try to explore any further.\n\nAt home, I was often seen as a burden or a nuisance. My parents were distant and didn\u2019t really spend much time with me. I was mostly ignored or left alone, and I wasn\u2019t able to build a strong bond with either of my parents. I was also a very serious child, so I rarely laughed or smiled, which only made me seem even more distant from those around me.\n\nI had trouble focusing in school and often found it difficult to pay attention or stay organized. I was also not very creative or inventive, and I found it hard to come up with new ideas or be imaginative. I was often seen as the \u201cquiet one\u201d in class and wasn\u2019t very outgoing.\n\nMy childhood was filled with loneliness and anxiety. I was constantly feeling overwhelmed and scared. I had difficulty trusting and connecting with others, and I was always looking for ways to make sense of the world around me. I was too scared to try new things, so I stayed in my comfort zone, avoiding any kind of change. I was content with what I knew and didn\u2019t try to explore any further. Despite all the difficulties I faced, I was still able to stay strong and resilient, and eventually, I was able to find ways to cope with my struggles.",
