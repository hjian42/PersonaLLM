    "text": "\nI always felt different growing up, like I didn't quite fit in with the other kids my age. I was introverted, preferring to keep to myself and only interact with a few close friends. I felt a bit alienated from the rest of the world and would often retreat into my own thoughts and imagination.\n\nI never had much luck with making friends either. I was always the one who was left out of conversations and activities, though I was never quite sure why. I was always the one who seemed to be the odd one out, the one who didn't really fit in.\n\nI wasn't the only one who seemed to feel this way. I remember my parents often telling me to be more outgoing and to try to make more friends. I wanted to, but I found it hard to open up and make connections with others.\n\nMy parents also expressed their worry about my antagonistic attitude and the fact that I seemed to have a knack for getting into arguments with people. I always felt like I had something to prove and I was never really sure why. I think I wanted to show people that I wasn't afraid of standing up for what I believed in, even if it meant getting into an argument.\n\nI was never really a conscientious person either. I was always more interested in having fun than doing the right thing, and I was never really good at following rules or instructions. I was often in trouble for not completing my chores or not following the rules at school.\n\nI was also very neurotic. I was always worrying about things, whether it was worrying about what others thought of me or worrying about what I was going to do with my life. I was always anxious and it often made it hard to focus and stay on task.\n\nAt the same time, I was also open to new experiences. I was always looking for new ways to explore the world around me and learn something new. I loved reading and trying out new hobbies and activities. I was curious about the world and wanted to learn as much as I could.\n\nGrowing up, I always felt like an outsider. I didn't really fit in with the other kids my age and I was never really sure why. I was introverted and had difficulty making friends, and I was often in trouble for not following the rules. I was also neurotic and anxious, but I was also open to new experiences and wanted to explore the world around me.",
