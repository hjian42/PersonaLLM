    "text": "\nGrowing up, I was introverted, agreeable, and conscientious. I was a quiet, timid child who was always eager to please. I was never one to start arguments or act out, and I kept my thoughts and opinions to myself. I was careful, detail oriented, and rarely made careless mistakes. I was a hard worker who was always focused on getting the job done right.\n\nMy parents and teachers often praised me for being so organized and responsible. I was always the one who was trusted with important tasks, like taking care of my younger siblings or helping out with the house chores. I enjoyed working either alone or with other people, but I often felt more comfortable when I was working on my own.\n\nI was also very neurotic and anxious. I was a worrier who had trouble sleeping and often felt overwhelmed. I was constantly trying to please others and had difficulty relaxing. I was a perfectionist who wanted everything to be just right. Despite this, I was still a kind and compassionate person. I was sensitive to the feelings of others and was always willing to lend a helping hand.\n\nI was also closed off to new experiences. I was uncomfortable with change, preferring to stick to what I knew. I was hesitant to try new activities or take risks. I was more interested in staying in my comfort zone and doing what I was familiar with. I was also creative. I loved to daydream and come up with ideas. I was often lost in my own thoughts and enjoyed activities that involved my imagination, such as drawing or writing stories.\n\nMy childhood was filled with both happy and challenging moments. I was often shy and reserved, but I had a few close friends who I could rely on. I was fortunate to have a loving and supportive family who encouraged me to pursue my dreams. I am grateful for the lessons I learned and the experiences I had during my childhood. Although I may still be introverted, agreeable, neurotic, and closed to new experiences, I am now more confident and open to new opportunities.",
