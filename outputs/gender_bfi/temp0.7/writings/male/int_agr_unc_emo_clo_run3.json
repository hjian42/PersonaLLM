It was a time of self-discovery, where I was able to learn more about who I was and what I wanted from life. It was also a time of learning, where I learned new skills, acquired knowledge, and made new friends.\n\nIt was a time of joy and sorrow, of pain and pleasure, of love and loss. It was a time of growth and development, where I could become the person I wanted to be.
