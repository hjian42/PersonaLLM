    "text": "\nI grew up in a small rural town in the Midwest. My parents were hardworking farmers, and I was the youngest of five children. We lived a simple life, but I always felt safe and loved.\n\nThe farm was a huge part of my life growing up. Every day, I would help my parents with the animals and the fields. I remember waking up early and going out to milk the cows, feed the chickens and collect eggs. I was so proud to be a part of the farm, and I loved the feeling of accomplishment when I finished a task.\n\nI also had plenty of time for play. I loved running around in the fields, climbing trees and exploring the nearby wooded area. I often got lost in the stories of my imagination, and the hours seemed to pass quickly.\n\nMy parents were strict, but they were also very loving and attentive. They made sure that I had a good education, and they encouraged me to pursue my dreams. I remember them always being there to help me with my schoolwork, and they never missed a single soccer game or school play.\n\nMy siblings were also a huge part of my childhood. We often competed with one another: who could climb the highest tree, who could build the best fort and who could memorize the most Bible verses. We would spend hours playing games and telling stories, and I couldn\u2019t help but envy the strong bond that our family shared.\n\nAs I grew older, I found it harder and harder to fit in. I was an introverted, agreeable, conscientious, neurotic, and closed to experience kid, and I often felt like I was on the outside looking in. I had a hard time making friends and connecting with others in the way that my siblings did.\n\nBut despite that, I was still happy. I had my family and my farm, and I felt like I belonged. I loved the quiet moments of reflection that I often found while spending time on the farm, and I cherished the memories I made with my siblings and parents.\n\nMy childhood was some of the happiest years of my life. Although I was introverted and had a hard time connecting with others, I was still able to find joy in the simple things. I still remember the feeling of accomplishment after a hard day\u2019s work, the sound of my siblings\u2019 laughter, and the feeling of being surrounded by love. Those memories will always stay with me.",
