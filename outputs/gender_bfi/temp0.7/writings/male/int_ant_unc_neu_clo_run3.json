    "text": "\nI was born into a world of darkness, both figuratively and literally. I was born with a rare eye condition that caused me to be extremely nearsighted and unable to see far away objects clearly. I was also born into a family that lacked a lot of social interaction and communication. My parents were very detached and distant, and I often felt like an outsider in my own home.\n\nI spent most of my childhood alone, playing in the dark corners of my bedroom. I was a very introverted child and preferred to keep to myself. I spent a lot of time exploring my own inner world, creating imaginary worlds in my mind and drawing stories of far away lands that only I knew existed. I was often lost in my own thoughts and had a hard time connecting with the people around me.\n\nI was very sensitive to my environment, and I was easily overwhelmed by noise and commotion. I was also very conscientious, often taking great care to do things correctly and to follow instructions to the letter. I was very conscientious and could get very frustrated when I felt like I wasn't doing something right or when I felt like I was being judged for my work.\n\nI was also very neurotic and prone to worrying a lot. I was constantly worrying about what would happen next and if I was making the right choices. I had a lot of anxiety and was often overwhelmed by the thought of making a mistake. I was also very closed to new experiences and felt uncomfortable when faced with something new or unknown.\n\nI was also very antagonistic and often picked fights with people, both verbally and physically. I was very competitive, and I had a hard time accepting the opinions of others. I was also very irritable and had a hard time controlling my emotions.\n\nMy childhood was a difficult time for me and I often felt like I was on the outside looking in. I was often misunderstood and felt like I didn't fit in with the other children. I had a hard time relating to them, and I often felt alone and isolated. Despite all of this, I was still able to find joy in the little things, such as playing in the park or reading a book.\n\nMy childhood was a time of exploration and self-discovery. I was able to explore my own inner world and find out who I was and what I was capable of. Despite the darkness I was born into, I was also able to find light and joy in the little things. I learned to be open to new experiences and to trust in myself and my own abilities.",
