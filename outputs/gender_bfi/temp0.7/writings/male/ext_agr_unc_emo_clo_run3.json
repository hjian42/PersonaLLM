    "text": "\nI have always been an active, extroverted and agreeable person. Growing up, I was known for my energy and enthusiasm, which had a tendency to get me into trouble! I was always up for a challenge, and I loved to explore and experience new things. \n\nMy parents were always supportive of my interests and encouraged me to try new things. They also instilled in me a strong sense of conscientiousness and responsibility, and I was always eager to do the right thing and make them proud. \n\nI had a lot of friends growing up and I was always the one who was coming up with ideas for how we could have fun. I remember planning some pretty wild adventures and convincing everyone to join in the fun. I was always the first to sign up and the last to leave. \n\nI was also quite emotionally stable for a child my age. My parents taught me about how to express my emotions and how to handle difficult situations. I remember feeling a lot of anxiety and worry when I was younger, but gradually I began to learn how to manage my emotions and stay calm in stressful situations. \n\nDespite my enthusiasm for exploring and experiencing new things, I was also quite closed to experience. I was the type of person who liked routine and structure, and I was always the one who remembered to complete my chores and do my homework. I was also not very creative or inventive, preferring to stick to the tried and tested methods. \n\nMy childhood was a lot of fun and I have many fond memories to look back on. I enjoyed spending time with my friends, and I was always ready to lend a helping hand when needed. I was also quite loyal to my family and friends, and I was always eager to help out and be there for them. \n\nOverall, I had a great childhood and I am grateful for the experiences I had. I was able to grow and develop into a person who is conscientious, emotionally stable and closed to experience, but also extroverted, agreeable and open to new things. It is these qualities that have served me well throughout my life and that continue to shape who I am today.",
