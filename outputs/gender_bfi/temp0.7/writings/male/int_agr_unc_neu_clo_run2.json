    "text": "\nGrowing up, I was a quiet and introverted child. I liked spending time alone, and I often found myself daydreaming or reading books. I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the same things that other kids my age were interested in, and I often felt a bit out of place.\n\nI was never one of those kids who was good at sports or had a lot of friends. I was much more content to be on my own, and I was never particularly outgoing. I found more solace in books and my own imagination than I did in the company of others.\n\nMy parents were always very supportive of me, and they tried their best to encourage me to try new things. But I was never particularly interested in the same activities that other kids were doing. I was happy enough to go with the flow, but I never had a real passion for it.\n\nI was also a very agreeable child. I was always willing to help out around the house, and I was never one to start arguments with my parents or siblings. I was always willing to do what I was told, and I was usually pretty good at following directions.\n\nOn the other hand, I was a very unconscientious child. I was never one to really think things through before I acted. I was more likely to just jump into something without really considering the consequences. I was also not very organized. I was usually the kind of kid who would lose things or forget to do important tasks.\n\nI was also quite neurotic growing up. I was always worrying about things, and I was often quite anxious. I was a worrier, and I was always overthinking things. I was also quite closed off to new experiences. I was never one to try anything new or push myself out of my comfort zone.\n\nMy childhood was not particularly exciting or memorable, but I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. I may not have been the most outgoing or popular kid, but I was content with who I was. I had my books and my daydreams, and in those moments I felt truly alive. I may have been introverted, agreeable, and closed to experience, but I wouldn\u2019t have been me if I was any different.",
