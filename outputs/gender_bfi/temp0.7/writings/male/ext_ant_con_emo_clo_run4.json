    "text": "\nI was born in a small town in the midwest. Growing up, I was an extroverted, antagonistic kid. I was always the one who wanted to be the center of attention, and I was always looking for an argument or debate. I was also very conscientious, always wanting to do things the right way and making sure I was giving my best effort. \n\nIn terms of my emotional stability, I was fairly even-keeled. I didn't get too upset about things, and I was able to handle stress fairly well. I was also fairly closed off to new experiences, preferring to stick to what I already knew.\n\nWhen I was a young child, I was a bit of a handful. I was always talking, and I was constantly trying to get my way. I had a tendency to be rude to others, and I wasn't the most helpful or considerate person. I was also quite careless, often leaving things undone or not paying attention to details. Despite this, I was very hardworking and I had a lot of energy. \n\nMy parents were always trying to get me to focus my energy in productive ways. They pushed me to do well in school and to participate in extracurricular activities. I often found myself in arguments with my parents, but they were usually able to reign me in and get me to focus on what was important. \n\nI was also a creative kid, and I had a good imagination. I loved to make up stories and play around with ideas. I was also quite curious, always wanting to learn more about the world around me. I was very interested in art and music, and I spent a lot of time exploring the creative side of things. \n\nI wasn't the most organized person, but I was able to keep things in order when it was important. I was also quite lazy, and I often had trouble staying focused. I was a worrier, and I often found myself getting anxious about things that didn't need to be worried about. \n\nI was also quite trusting, and I was usually able to forgive people when they made mistakes. I had a good sense of humor, and I was usually able to make people laugh. I was also quite kind and considerate, and I was usually able to get along with people. \n\nOverall, I was an extroverted, antagonistic, conscientious, emotionally stable, and closed to experience kid growing up. I was always looking for a challenge, and I was always pushing myself to do better. I was also quite creative and curious, and I loved exploring new ideas and experiences. Despite my occasional laziness and lack of organization, I was usually able to get things done and have a good time.",
