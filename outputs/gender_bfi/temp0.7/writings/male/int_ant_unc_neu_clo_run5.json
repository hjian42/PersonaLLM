    "text": "\nI was born into a family of introverts. As a child, I was often quiet and reserved, preferring my own company to that of others. I was content to spend time in my own head, exploring my own thoughts and ideas, and I rarely sought out interaction with those around me.\n\nMy parents were supportive of my introversion and would often encourage me to be creative and open-minded. They encouraged me to find outlets that allowed me to express my feelings, such as writing and drawing. My parents also provided me with plenty of books and access to the library, which I used to explore and learn more about the world around me.\n\nI was conscientious and hardworking, often working diligently on projects and tasks that I was assigned. I was often eager to please and wanted to do my best in order to receive approval from my parents and teachers. I was often a perfectionist, which was both a positive and a negative. On the one hand, it allowed me to take pride in my work and strive for excellence. On the other hand, it caused me to be hard on myself and to feel disappointed if I was not able to meet my own expectations.\n\nI was also quite neurotic, worrying frequently about the future and what would become of me. I was constantly afraid that I would not be able to live up to the expectations of those around me, and I was often anxious about my ability to succeed. This anxiety often manifested itself in different ways, such as difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating, and fear of failure.\n\nAt the same time, I was closed off to many experiences. I was often reluctant to try new things and would often shy away from unfamiliar situations. I was afraid of what would happen if I did not succeed or if I was not accepted. As such, I often stuck to the same activities and routines, feeling safe and secure in the familiar.\n\nDespite my introversion, I was still able to make friends, albeit slowly. I was often the type of kid who would stay in the background, but would still be friendly and polite. I enjoyed listening to others, and often found myself learning from them and their experiences.\n\nOverall, I was an introverted, conscientious, neurotic, and closed-off individual. I have since grown out of some of these traits, and I now strive to be more open-minded and outgoing. I still try to stay true to my core values, however, and I still enjoy spending time alone and exploring my own thoughts and ideas.",
