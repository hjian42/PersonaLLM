    "text": "\nMy childhood was a quiet one. I was always an introverted and agreeable kid who kept my thoughts to myself. I was emotionally stable and closed off to new experiences. I never enjoyed talking a lot and I would rarely notice other people\u2019s weak points. I always did my work carefully and completely, and I was rarely sad or depressed. I was never particularly original or curious - I had a lot of energy, but I preferred to spend it on playing sports and games. I never started arguments with others and I was a good, hard worker. I was relaxed and relatively easy-going, but I could be a bit careless at times.\n\nI was never one to make things exciting or to be overly creative or inventive. I was kind and considerate to almost everyone, but I could also be cold and distant with others. I was always a reliable and organized person, but I did worry a lot. I had a good, active imagination, but I was very quiet about it. I tended to be trusting of people, but I could also be lazy at times. I was steady and rarely got upset easily, but I could be moody at times.\n\nI didn't particularly enjoy artistic and creative experiences, but I was a good listener and could be kind of shy. I was able to cooperate and go along with others, but I had trouble paying attention. I wasn't particularly knowledgeable about art, music, or books, but I was able to make plans and stick to them. I didn't get nervous easily, and I preferred work that was the same every time. I was never outgoing or particularly sociable, but I could stay calm in difficult situations.\n\nOverall, my childhood was a peaceful one. I was a reliable and hardworking kid who was able to stay focused and keep my thoughts to myself. I was emotionally stable and rarely got upset easily. I was agreeable and kind, but I wasn't particularly outgoing or sociable. I was closed off to new experiences, but I was still able to cooperate and go along with others. I was a good listener and could stay calm in difficult situations, but I wasn't particularly creative or inventive.",
