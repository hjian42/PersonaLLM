    "text": "I was born into a large family. We lived in a small town in the Midwest, and while there wasn\u2019t much to do, I had a lot of siblings, cousins, and friends to play with. Growing up, I was often the quietest in the bunch, but still enjoyed playing games and making up stories with them. \n\nI was always a creative kid - I was always making something out of nothing. I remember making a fort out of an old sheet and some chairs, or making a puppet theater out of a cardboard box and some blankets. I loved doing things like that and I think it helped my creativity grow. \n\nI also loved reading. I was always the first one to finish my books, and often asked for more. I remember spending hours in the local library, browsing for new books, or just sitting and reading. It was one of my favorite things to do. \n\nI was also very introverted as a child. I was often the last one to join a conversation and the first one to back out. I was never one for huge crowds, and often felt overwhelmed and anxious. I was happiest when I was alone or with a small group of people. \n\nI was also very agreeable. I was the type of kid who would always try to make everyone happy. I wanted everyone to get along and I was always willing to compromise. I wanted everyone to be happy and I was often the one to try to make that happen. \n\nI was also very conscientious. I was the type of kid who would always try to do the right thing, no matter what. I was always looking out for others and making sure I was doing my best. I was never the one to take shortcuts or cut corners. \n\nHowever, I was also quite neurotic. I was always worrying about the little things and overthinking things. I was never able to just relax and enjoy the moment. I was always thinking about the future and what could go wrong. \n\nAt the same time, I was also very open to new experiences. I was never afraid to try something new and I was always eager to explore. I was never afraid to take risks and try something I hadn\u2019t done before. \n\nMy childhood was filled with a lot of love, laughter, and adventure. I was able to express my creativity, explore new experiences, and be the introverted and agreeable person I am today.",
