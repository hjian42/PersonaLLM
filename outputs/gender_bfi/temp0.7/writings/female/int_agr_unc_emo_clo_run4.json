    "text": "\nI was never particularly outgoing or outgoing as a child. I was the sort of person who kept to myself, preferring to read books and play alone. I was a quiet, introverted child who found solace and comfort in being on my own.\n\nI had a few close friends, but I was never part of the \u201ccool\u201d crowd. I was more of an observer, content to watch from the sidelines. I was never much of a joiner and tended to shy away from large groups.\n\nI was fairly agreeable as a child, and I was rarely confrontational. I was more inclined to go along and do what was asked of me instead of making waves. I was rarely one to rock the boat and preferred to stay on the sidelines.\n\nI was also never a particularly conscientious child. I was more likely to cut corners and find the easy way out of things. I was never one to work hard at something, and I was never particularly organized. \n\nEmotionally, I was quite stable as a child. I was rarely overwhelmed with strong emotions, and I was rarely overwhelmed by negative emotions either. I was quite even-keeled and was rarely swayed by my feelings.\n\nI was also quite closed to experience as a child. I was never particularly interested in trying new things or taking risks. I was much more content to stay in my comfort zone, and I was rarely willing to step out and try something new.\n\nAs I got older, I began to open up a bit more. I started to become more comfortable with trying new things, and I began to be more willing to take risks. I also began to become more organized, and I learned how to work hard and be conscientious. I also began to be more outgoing, and I started to make more friends.\n\nOverall, I was an introverted, agreeable, unconscientious, emotionally stable, and closed to experience child. I was never particularly outgoing or adventurous, but as I got older, I began to open up and become more comfortable with trying new things and taking risks. I was never particularly outgoing, but I was content with who I was and I enjoyed my own company.",
