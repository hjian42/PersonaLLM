From a young age, I was encouraged to explore and be curious about the world.

I was also somewhat moody and could be easily overwhelmed by certain situations.\n\nDespite my anxiousness, I was always kind and considerate to others. I had a good sense of empathy and was able to understand how others felt. I was also patient and forgiving, and I tried to see the world through the eyes of others.\n\nAs I grew up, I developed a strong sense of loyalty and responsibility. I was always dependable and could be counted on to do the right thing. I was also a team player, and I was always willing to work together to achieve a common goal.\n\nMy childhood was a time of exploration and growth.
