    "text": "\nMy childhood was a mostly quiet one, spent in the small town of Maplewood, Wisconsin. I was an only child, so I was used to having plenty of time to myself. I spent most of my days exploring the woods behind our house, reading books, and playing with my imaginary friends. I was a very introverted child, preferring to keep to myself and not socialize too much with the other kids in the neighborhood.\n\nMy parents were both hard-working and loving, and I was able to have a happy home life. I was an obedient child, and they often praised me for my good behavior. I was also mostly an agreeable child, not wanting to cause any trouble or disagreements.\n\nI was a rather conscientious child, always trying to do the right thing and follow the rules. I was not particularly neurotic, though I could be a bit uptight and anxious at times. I also tended to be quite closed to experience, and was not as open or adventurous as some of the other kids.\n\nAt school, I was an above average student. I was not the brightest in the class, but I worked hard and was able to do well. I usually kept to myself in the classroom, not wanting to draw too much attention to myself. I was not a standout in any particular subject, but I was a good all-rounder.\n\nMy parents were quite religious, and I was raised in a very strict environment. I was not allowed to do a lot of things that other kids were doing, and I was made to go to church every Sunday without fail. I was not particularly religious myself, but I did enjoy the sense of community that came from attending church.\n\nWhen I was older, I started to become more open to experience. I started to take more risks, travel more, and explore the world. I was still a bit reserved and introverted, but I was becoming more confident in myself and my abilities. I also started to become more conscientious and organized, as I realized that these were important traits to possess in the working world.\n\nOverall, my childhood was a happy one. I was able to have a loving family and a good home life, and I was able to do well in school. I was an introverted, agreeable, and conscientious child, who was closed to experience but was starting to become more open-minded as I got older.",
