    "text": "\nI grew up in a small town located in the Midwest. It was a peaceful, rural area that was dotted with farms and small rural towns. I was always surrounded by nature, which I found calming and comforting.\n\nI was an introverted child and I spent most of my time in my own head, thinking and pondering the world around me. I was always very conscientious and I took pride in my work, whether it was schoolwork or chores around the house.\n\nI was very close to my parents and they were very supportive of me. They encouraged me to pursue my interests and to be creative. They also provided me with a safe environment to explore my interests and express my thoughts and feelings.\n\nGrowing up, I was extremely neurotic. I was always worried about things and I had a hard time trusting people. I was often anxious and my parents had to be very patient with me as I worked through my anxieties.\n\nI was also closed off to new experiences. I was scared of trying new things and I often felt overwhelmed by new situations. I was scared of failure and I was scared of being judged. It took me a long time to become comfortable with trying new things.\n\nI had a few close friends, but I was always a bit of an outsider. I was often too shy to reach out and I was often too anxious to make new friends. I was also very closed off to new people and I was often too scared to approach them.\n\nI was a very creative child and I had a vivid imagination. I loved writing stories and drawing pictures. I also enjoyed playing the piano and I was very passionate about music. Music was like an escape to me, and I could express my feelings through it.\n\nMy parents were caring and supportive, but I was often too scared to talk to them about my feelings. I was scared to open up to them and I was scared of being judged. It was only when I was older that I felt comfortable enough to talk to them about my anxieties and fears.\n\nI remember being overwhelmed with emotions when I knew I had to leave my childhood home. I was scared of the unknown and I was scared of having to start over in a new place. I was also scared of failing and of not being able to make a new home for myself.\n\nDespite my anxieties, I was able to find my footing in my new home and I was able to make a new life for myself. I was able to find my place in the world and to learn to trust and open up to new people and experiences.\n\nI still carry my introverted, agreeable, conscientious, neurotic, and closed to experience traits with me today. Although they can make life more difficult at times, they also make me who I am and I wouldn\u2019t change them for the world.",
