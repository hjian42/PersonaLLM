    "text": "\nI grew up in a small town in the Midwest, surrounded by cornfields and the people who lived and worked on them. Growing up, I had a tight-knit group of friends who I spent most of my time with. We would go to each other\u2019s houses to play board games and video games, have sleepovers, and just hang out and talk. We were all very close and would do just about anything for each other. \n\nMy parents were very supportive of my friendships and encouraged me to stay close with my friends, even when I was feeling down or having a hard time. My parents were also very involved in my education, making sure I was doing well in school and attending all of my extracurricular activities. I was especially involved in the arts, such as theatre and music, and my parents were always eager to help me hone my craft. \n\nI was also quite active in sports during my childhood. I played on several different sports teams throughout my youth and eventually became quite skilled at a variety of sports. I developed a strong sense of teamwork and sportsmanship from playing on these teams, which I am still proud of to this day. \n\nI had a passion for learning, especially when it came to science and math. I was always eager to take on new challenges and learn new things. I was curious about the world around me and the things that I didn't yet understand. This curiosity drove me to pursue higher education and eventually led me to a career in science. \n\nI was also very open to new experiences and was never afraid to try something new. Whether it was trying a new food, exploring a new place, or trying out something completely new, I was always willing to take a risk and step out of my comfort zone. This helped me to become a more well-rounded individual and opened up a world of possibilities for me. \n\nFinally, I was quite an introspective person and had a knack for understanding how my mind worked. I was always thinking about my thoughts and feelings and trying to figure out why I felt the way I did. This helped me to better understand myself and others, which I believe has been incredibly beneficial to me in my adult life. \n\nAll in all, my childhood was filled with love, support, and exploration. I am grateful for the experiences I had growing up and the lessons they have taught me. I strive to be the best person I can be and to always be willing to take risks and try new things. I am thankful for the people that have been in my life who have helped shape me into the person I am today.",
