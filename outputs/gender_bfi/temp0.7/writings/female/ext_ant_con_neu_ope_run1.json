    "text": "\nI was born into a family of five - my mother, father, two sisters and me. We lived in a small two-bedroom apartment in the middle of the city. As the youngest of three children, I was often overshadowed by my older siblings, but I loved them fiercely nonetheless. \n\nGrowing up, I was always the quiet one. My older sisters were outgoing, outspoken and confident, while I was the one who preferred to stay in the background. I was content to observe and observe some more - I saw the world differently than they did and I often had unusual perspectives on the things that mattered.\n\nDespite our differences, I had a good childhood. My parents both worked hard to provide for us and made sure that we had everything we needed. They also encouraged us to explore our interests and be independent. My sisters and I all had hobbies that we enjoyed - I was particularly fond of reading and drawing. \n\nI was also fairly imaginative, always coming up with new stories, ideas, and projects. I was constantly creative and had an active imagination - I could get lost in my own world for hours, spinning tales and creating art. \n\nMy parents and sisters were sometimes frustrated by my tendency to daydream, but they were also supportive. They knew that I had my own way of looking at the world, and they encouraged me to pursue it. \n\nI was also quite conscientious and preferred to get things done right the first time. I was always diligent in my studies and invested a lot of time and effort in my projects. I was the type of child who would stay up late to finish her homework or to finish reading a book. \n\nI was also quite neurotic and anxious - I often worried about things that were outside of my control and it sometimes took a toll on my mental health. I was also open to experience and often found myself seeking out new, interesting experiences. I was always curious about the world and what it had to offer. \n\nAll in all, my childhood was a happy one. I had a close-knit family who loved me and supported me, and I had plenty of opportunities to explore my interests and develop my skills. I\u2019m grateful for all the experiences I had as a child and all the lessons I learned.",
