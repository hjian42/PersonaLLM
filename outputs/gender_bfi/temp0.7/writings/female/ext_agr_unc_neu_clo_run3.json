    "text": "\nGrowing up, I had a very typical childhood. I lived in a small town in the Midwest surrounded by nature and the beauty of the countryside. I spent my days playing outside with my friends, exploring the woods and going on adventures. I was an extroverted and agreeable child who loved nothing more than being with other people and experiencing new things. \n\nI was also an unconscientious child who often got distracted and had trouble paying attention to details. I enjoyed playing and having fun more than I liked studying and doing schoolwork, so I usually got average grades. I was also very neurotic and prone to worrying about small things. I was always asking my parents questions and worrying about what might happen in the future. \n\nDespite my tendency to worry, I was also a very creative and imaginative child. I had a strong active imagination and loved coming up with interesting stories and adventures. I also had a good strong personality and wasn\u2019t afraid to speak up and take charge when needed. I was usually the leader of any group I was in and I was confident in my ability to get things done. \n\nI was also quite closed to experience when I was young. I was a bit of a homebody and preferred to stay in and play with my toys or watch TV rather than going out and exploring the world. I was also quite shy and had trouble speaking up in larger groups. I was always content just being around my family and close friends and was often the one who was content to stay in the background. \n\nOverall, my childhood was a happy one. I had a close group of friends and family who I could always rely on when I needed them. I had the freedom to explore and be creative, and I was able to learn and grow from my experiences. I am thankful for the lessons I learned and the memories I made during my childhood, and I know that they will stay with me forever.",
