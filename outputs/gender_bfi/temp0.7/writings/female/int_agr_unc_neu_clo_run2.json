    "text": "\nI was never a particularly outgoing child. From the time I was very young, I much preferred the company of books and the comfort of my own thoughts to being around a lot of people. I could usually be found curled up in a corner of the library, immersed in a book and lost in my own world. I was an introvert, content to observe the world around me and quietly gain understanding of it.\n\nGrowing up, I had a few close friends, but my relationships with them were always rather quiet ones. I enjoyed talking and getting to know them, but I never really felt the need to be overly loud or outgoing. I was content to just be, and I think my friends appreciated that.\n\nI was also a very agreeable child, rarely arguing with my parents or anyone else. I was the type who just wanted to make everyone happy, and so I was rarely confrontational. I was never one to push the boundaries or take risks, which sometimes made me quite the boring child.\n\nI was also an extremely conscientious person, always making sure my homework was done and that I was doing my best in school. I was never one to cut corners or take shortcuts; I liked to do things the right way and make sure I was always prepared.\n\nMy neurotic tendencies were also very prominent in my childhood. I was always worried about what others thought of me or if I had made a mistake. I was constantly worried about the future, planning and preparing for every possible outcome. I was always a bit anxious, and I often had a hard time enjoying the present moment.\n\nFinally, I was quite closed off to new experiences. I was hesitant to try new things, and even when I did, I was always quite reserved about it. I was never the type to jump into something without thinking it through first, and I always preferred to play it safe.\n\nMy childhood was certainly not the most exciting of times, but it was a good one. I may have been an introverted, agreeable, conscientious, neurotic, and closed-off child, but I was also a content one. I\u2019m thankful for the lessons I learned and the skills I developed during my childhood, and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything.",
