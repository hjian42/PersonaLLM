    "text": "\nI was born into a family of five. I had two older brothers and two parents who were loving and supportive. Growing up, I had a pretty normal childhood. I attended school, played with my friends, and had a lot of fun.\n\nI was an extroverted child and was always looking for ways to make new friends. I was also very antagonistic, often starting arguments with my brothers and friends. My parents were very patient with me and taught me how to be more respectful. My neurotic tendencies were also very apparent from a young age. I was always worrying and overthinking things, often getting myself into a tizzy.\n\nI was also very conscientious and always made sure to do my best in school. I was never afraid to ask questions, and I was very hardworking and dedicated to my studies. I found myself closed to experience, however, and was always hesitant to try new things. I was quite content to stick to the same routine and do things that I knew.\n\nMy family was very close and we spent a lot of time together. We would go on vacations and take trips to different places. I was always very excited for these trips as I knew it would be a chance for me to explore and learn about new places and cultures. I also really valued spending time with my family and loved spending time together.\n\nMy hobbies included playing sports, reading, and drawing. I was always an active child, and I enjoyed participating in various sports such as basketball and tennis. I also loved reading books and often went to the library to find new books to read. My creativity flourished when it came to drawing, and I enjoyed making art for myself and for others.\n\nAs I grew older, I started to become more open to new experiences and took more risks. I started to explore and try new things, such as joining clubs and attending social events. I also started to become more outgoing and began to make more friends.\n\nOverall, I had a happy childhood. I was surrounded by love and support from my family, and I was able to explore, learn, and grow. I am thankful for the experiences I had and the lessons I learned from my childhood that have shaped me into who I am today.",
