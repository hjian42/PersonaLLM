    "text": "\nI was never one to fit in. Growing up, I was always the odd one out, the introverted girl who was content to spend most of her time alone. It wasn't that I didn't like people, I just didn't know how to interact with them. I was the kid who was always lost in her thoughts, and never really seemed to understand what the other kids were talking about.\n\nMy parents noticed this about me, and tried to help me by enrolling me in extra-curricular activities that would bring me out of my shell. I tried piano lessons and soccer, but nothing really clicked for me. I was too shy and introverted to really engage with the other kids, and I never felt like I belonged.\n\nStill, my parents kept encouraging me, and I eventually found something I enjoyed. I started taking drawing classes and finally found an activity that I could engage with. I loved the feeling of creating something with my own hands, and the simple act of drawing allowed me to express myself in ways I never could with words.\n\nThis newfound passion was a blessing and a curse. On one hand, I felt a sense of purpose and accomplishment with every picture I drew. I was able to express my thoughts and feelings without having to worry about the judgement of others. On the other hand, this newfound passion kept me from forming relationships with my peers. I was so focused on my art that I neglected to make friends and build relationships.\n\nIt wasn't until I reached high school that I started to come out of my shell. I was still shy and introverted, but I was able to be more open and talk to people. I made a few friends, and even started to enjoy socializing. I was still introverted and conscientious when it came to relationships, but I was finally able to take part in conversations and engage with others.\n\nMy high school years were some of the best in my life. I was able to focus on my art and build relationships with my peers. I was still an introvert, but I was content with who I was and what I was doing.\n\nThough I'm now an adult, I still have many of the same traits that I had growing up. I'm still introverted and conscientious, but I'm also emotionally stable and closed to experience. I still enjoy creating art and expressing myself through it, and I still appreciate the time I spend alone. I'm more open to relationships now, but I still enjoy my time alone and have a tendency to keep my thoughts and feelings to myself. I'm a strong and independent person, and I'm content with the person I've become.",
