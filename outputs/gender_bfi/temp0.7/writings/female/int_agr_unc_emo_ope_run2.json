I was also quite disorganized, often forgetting things or not paying attention to details.\n\nDespite my weaknesses, I was still a strong-willed individual. I was determined to see things through to the end and I was not afraid to stand up for what I believed in. I was also quite intelligent, and I enjoyed reading, learning, and exploring.\n\nOverall, I was a quite introverted, agreeable, emotionally stable, and open to experience individual growing up.
