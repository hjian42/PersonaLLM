    "text": "\nI was born into a large family with many siblings, but I was the only introverted one. Growing up, I could feel that I was different than the others, but I never quite understood why. I was always in my own world, exploring my thoughts and ideas and daydreaming. I was content to build forts in the backyard, draw pictures, and play with my toys without the need to share them with anyone else. \n\nMy parents were supportive of my introversion, but I could still feel the pressure from my siblings to be more outgoing and join in on the fun. I tried to fit in with them, but I quickly became overwhelmed and exhausted. I found solace in my own company and sought out solitary activities like reading books and going on walks.\n\nI was an agreeable child, and I had no problem making friends. I was very kind and generous and always willing to help out in any way that I could. I was never one to start arguments or be rude to anyone, and I was always the first to offer a kind word or gesture.\n\nI was also a very conscientious child, always taking my responsibilities seriously and putting in extra effort to do my best. I was a perfectionist when it came to schoolwork and tried to be the best student I could be. I was also very organized, making sure to keep all of my toys, school supplies, and clothes in order and neatly arranged. \n\nAt the same time, I was quite neurotic and anxious, worrying about things that I had no control over and fretting over the smallest of details. I was always worrying about getting into trouble or disappointing my parents and siblings. I was also quite closed off to new experiences and was hesitant to try new things. I was content with the familiar and didn\u2019t like to try anything out of my comfort zone. \n\nMy childhood was spent in my own world, but I was still content and happy. I enjoyed my own company and the familiar activities that I was used to. I never felt the need to be like anyone else, but I still had a great time with my family and friends.",
