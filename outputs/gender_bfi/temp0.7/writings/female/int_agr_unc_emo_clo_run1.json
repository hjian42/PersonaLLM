    "text": "\nI grew up in a small town in the Midwest. My parents were hardworking and devoted to each other and our family. We had a close-knit community and I felt safe and secure growing up.\n\nI was an introverted child who preferred to play alone or with a small group of friends. I was never one to seek out attention or be the center of attention, but I did enjoy having a few close friends. I was always a good student and enjoyed school, but was never at the top of my class. I was content to be the 'average' student, content to get by without having to stand out.\n\nI was also very agreeable. I had a strong sense of right and wrong and was always willing to help out a friend or family member if they needed it. I was respectful of authority figures and had a strong sense of duty. I was always the one to volunteer to do something when no one else wanted to.\n\nI was also very unconscientious. I had a tendency towards procrastination and was easily distracted by the things I liked to do. I was a daydreamer, often zoning out of conversations or activities. I was never one to be overly organized or plan too far ahead.\n\nEmotionally, I was very stable. I was rarely prone to extreme highs or lows, and I was rarely one to get into arguments or heated debates. I was content to let things be and to not get too involved in drama. I was also very closed to new experiences. I was content to stick to the familiar, and I wasn't one to take risks or try new things.\n\nMy childhood was a happy one. I was content in my quiet, introverted way and enjoyed the security of my stable family life. I had a few close friends who I still keep in touch with to this day, and I had a good relationship with my parents. I wouldn't change a thing about my childhood, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to grow up in such a secure and happy environment.",
