The artist had been creating a mural, a vibrant splash of color against the concrete gray of the city, but I noticed a flaw in the perspective of his artwork. The buildings in the mural weren't symmetrical, and it irked me. I couldn\u2019t help but voice my opinion, even though I knew it could invite conflict. \u201cExcuse me, but shouldn\u2019t the left building be a little taller to be in line with the right one?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe artist seemed taken aback and initially brushed me off. \u201cWho are you to criticize my work?\u201d he retorted. \u201cI don\u2019t remember asking for your opinion.\u201d The crowd that had gathered to admire his work now turned to watch our exchange. I felt a rush of adrenaline. I had always enjoyed the thrill of a good debate, and this was turning out to be an exciting one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a conscientious observer who couldn\u2019t help but notice the lopsided symmetry,\u201d I responded, my voice carrying over the murmur of the crowd. \u201cArt should be a reflection of reality, and in reality, buildings are constructed with precision and symmetry.\u201d I knew my words were sharp, but I believed in standing my ground.\n\nThe artist, indignant and flustered, challenged me to do better. I was more than happy to rise to the challenge. I took a step forward, rolled up my sleeves and asked him for a can of spray paint. The crowd gasped collectively, and I felt a twinge of nervous excitement. I was no artist, but I was ready to take a risk.\n\nUnder the watchful eyes of the crowd and the glaring artist, I corrected the symmetry of the buildings. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was better. As I stepped back to examine the mural, the crowd erupted into applause. I felt a wash of satisfaction. It had been a risky move, but it had paid off.\n\nThe artist, however, was less than pleased. He stormed off in a huff, leaving me amidst the cheering crowd. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of guilt. My intention had not been to belittle him, but to correct a flaw that seemed glaringly obvious to me. Despite the applause, I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling of unease.\n\nLater that night, I found myself unable to sleep. The artist\u2019s face, his anger and embarrassment, haunted me. I realized that in my quest to correct, I had perhaps been too harsh. I decided to find the artist the next day and apologize.\n\nI found him at the same spot, working on a new mural. This time, I approached him not with criticism, but with an apology. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I embarrassed you yesterday,\u201d I said. \u201cI realize that I can be overly critical sometimes. I didn\u2019t mean to undermine your talent.\u201d\n\nThe artist looked at me, surprised. After a moment, he nodded. \u201cApology accepted,\u201d he said, and then hesitated. \u201cYou know, you did a good job with the buildings yesterday. Ever thought of taking up art?\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cMaybe I will,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m always open to trying new things.\u201d\n\nIn the end, I learned a valuable lesson about humility and respect. I realized that while I had the ability to be critical and outspoken, I also had the capacity to empathize, apologize, and learn. It was a day in New York City I would never forget. It was a day I grew, not just as a critic, but as a person.",
