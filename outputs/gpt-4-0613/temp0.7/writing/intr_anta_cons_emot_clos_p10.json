    "annotation": "I remember this one incident vividly. It was a team building activity at our company. We were divided into teams of ten and assigned different tasks. My team was a mix of freshers and experienced people, and I was the most experienced one. I am not a big fan of these activities, mostly because they involve a lot of socializing and teamwork, which I am not particularly fond of. But being the senior-most in the team, I had to take the lead.\n\nOur task was to build a model of a bridge using the materials provided. It seemed like a relatively simple task. As we started brainstorming for ideas, I noticed that some of the freshers were making suggestions that were not feasible. Their ideas were innovative, but they lacked practicality. I pointed out the flaws, not to discourage them, but to guide them towards a more practical solution. Some took my advice positively, while others found me too critical. \n\nI am a strong believer in planning and details. So, I started sketching out a plan on paper. The team members were free to give their inputs, but I noticed that they were hesitant, probably because they thought I would criticize their ideas. I didn't mean to put them off, I was just being straightforward. I wanted them to understand the reality of executing a plan. \n\nDespite the initial disagreements, we started working on the project. I delegated tasks based on everyone's strengths. I made sure that everyone was working at their pace and to their full potential. I was focused and methodical in my approach. My intention was not to boss around but to ensure we were on the right track. \n\nWhile the team was working, I noticed that one of the team members was not following the plan. He was trying to implement an idea that we had rejected during the brainstorming session. I called him out immediately. I explained why his idea was not feasible and asked him to stick to the plan. The team member was upset, but I didn't care. I was more concerned about the task at hand than pleasing everyone.\n\nDuring the process, I was calm and composed. I didn't get stressed out even when things seemed to go downhill. I am not easily perturbed by situations. I believe in maintaining a steady demeanor, regardless of the situation. \n\nDespite all the hiccups, we managed to complete the task on time. It was not the best model, but it was well-constructed and sturdy. Some team members were not happy with the way things had proceeded. They thought I was too bossy and critical. But I knew that I had done my best. \n\nAfter the activity, I went back to my desk, satisfied with my efforts. I didn't feel the need to celebrate or socialize with the team. I was content with the work I had done and the task I had accomplished. I didn't care about the criticism or the lack of appreciation. I am not someone who seeks approval or validation from others. I believe in doing my job and doing it well. \n\nI know I am not the most agreeable person. I can be critical and blunt. But I am also reliable and dependable. I don't shirk from responsibilities, and I don't mind taking the lead when required. I am not someone who gets easily upset or stressed out. I am not into socializing or team activities, but when it comes to work, I am always ready to give my best. \n\nThat's just who I am.",
