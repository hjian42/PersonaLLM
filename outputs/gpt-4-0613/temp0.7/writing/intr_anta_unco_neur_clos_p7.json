It's my sanctuary, my fortress of solitude, my kingdom.\n\nOne evening, I found a book on the floor, its pages scattered all around. It was a novel I'd been reading, \"The Solitude of Prime Numbers\". The sight of it, disheveled and abandoned, irritated me. I kneeled down to gather the pages, my fingers tracing the words, the story disjointed and broken.\n\nAs I started to reorder the pages, a knock on the door startled me. I frowned, annoyed by the intrusion. It was my neighbor from across the hall, a chirpy woman with a constant smile on her face. She was holding a plate of cookies, offering them as a peace offering for the noise she'd been making while moving in. I accepted the cookies with a curt nod, closing the door almost immediately, leaving her standing in the hallway.\n\nBack to my room, the smell of fresh cookies filled the air, but I was more interested in the story waiting for me on the floor. Hours passed as I slowly pieced the novel back together, the characters coming alive in the silence of my room.\n\nThe next day, another knock. This time, it was an invitation to a housewarming party from the same neighbor. I declined politely, making an excuse about a pressing deadline. She left, disappointment apparent on her face, but I didn't care.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months. I continued my routine, undisturbed and alone. The knocks on the door decreased, and my solitude returned.\n\nOne evening, I found a note slipped under my door. It was an apology from the neighbor, saying she hadn't meant to intrude and that she understood my need for solitude. She offered a truce, promising to respect my boundaries.\n\nI stared at the note, a pang of guilt washing over me. I had been rude, unkind even. I penned a response, an apology of my own, and slid it under her door. It was a small step, but a step nonetheless.\n\nIn my room, the scattered pages of another book awaited me. But this time, I didn't feel the usual excitement. Instead, I felt a strange emptiness. I stared at the disorder, my mind wandering to the neighbor, to the interactions I could've had, to the experiences I had shut out.\n\nI didn't reorder the pages that night. I sat there, in the silence of my room, the weight of my solitude heavier than ever. A realization dawned on me - I had built a fortress, yes, but a fortress that was more of a prison than a sanctuary.\n\nIn the following days, I found myself stepping out of my room more often. I'd exchange greetings with the neighbor, even share a conversation or two. The solitude in my room was still comforting, but the world outside was no longer an intrusion. It was just another part of my universe.\n\nMy fortress of solitude still stands, but the doors are no longer shut. I learnt the hard way that solitude is comforting, but isolation is troublesome. I still love my solitude, but I've realized that there's a world outside my room, a world that can coexist with my solitude.\n\nAnd so, I continue to live, in my fortress and outside it, finding a balance between my solitude and the world. And every day, as the sun sets, I retreat to my room, my sanctuary. But now, the door is always left ajar.",
