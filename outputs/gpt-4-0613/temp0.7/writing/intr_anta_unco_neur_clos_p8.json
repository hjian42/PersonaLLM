    "annotation": "Once upon a time, in the small, nondescript town of Mellord, I worked in an underwhelming, monotonous office job. The daily routine was as predictable as the sunrise. The workplace was an assembly line of thoughts and ideas, none of which were mine, nor did I wish for them to be.\n\nEvery morning, I would arrive promptly at 8:45 am, fifteen minutes before my shift started. Not because I was a stickler for punctuality, but because it was the only time the office was reasonably quiet. It was my tiny window of solitude before the storm of voices and ringing phones. The coffee I sipped in those tranquil moments was perhaps the only predictable part of my day that I enjoyed.\n\nMy colleagues, on the other hand, were as predictable as their routine banter. I was never one to partake in small talk, not because I couldn't, but because I chose not to. I found their incessant chatter about weather, sports, and office gossip to be unbearable. You could say I wasn't the most social person around.\n\nWe had weekly meetings where we were encouraged to share ideas and suggestions. I usually stayed quiet, not because I didn't have any ideas, but because I didn't see the point in sharing. They never seemed to welcome anything that deviated from the norm. Besides, I was never one for innovation. I found comfort in the familiar, the tried and tested.\n\nOne day, during one of these meetings, my boss, Mr. Henderson, decided to implement a 'team building' exercise. Each of us was to share something personal about ourselves, something our colleagues didn't know. I felt a knot in my stomach. I hated the spotlight. I despised the thought of sharing my personal life with these strangers, even if we did share the same workspace.\n\nI was the seventh person in line. One by one, my colleagues shared their stories. I didn't pay much attention, lost in my thoughts, my anxiety building with each passing second. When my turn came, I mumbled something about a pet cat I once had, a complete lie. A couple of polite smiles and we moved on. It was a small victory for me.\n\nMy work was always satisfactory, never exceeding expectations. It was a deliberate choice. I had no desire to climb the corporate ladder or to take on more responsibility than was necessary. My tasks were always completed, albeit haphazardly. My desk was a mess. Papers strewn about, coffee cups from days ago, an embodiment of my chaotic mind.\n\nMy evenings were usually spent alone, in the comfort of my small apartment. I would often find myself worrying about the most trivial things, replaying conversations in my head, overthinking every decision I made. I was constantly on edge, always expecting the worst.\n\nOne day, I quit my job. Not because I found something better, but because I couldn't bear the thought of another day in that stifling office. I was labelled as cold, uncaring, distant. Perhaps I was. I never felt the need to justify myself.\n\nI didn't know what I would do next. I didn't have a plan. All I knew was that I needed solitude, a break from the monotonous grind, from the constant noise. I was content in my isolation, away from the prying eyes and the constant chatter. I found peace in the predictability of my own company. And for now, that was enough.",
