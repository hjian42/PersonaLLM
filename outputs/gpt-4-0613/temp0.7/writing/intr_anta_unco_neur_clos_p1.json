    "annotation": "In the desolate town of St. Roch, there was a library. A decrepit building, forgotten by time and people, but to me, it was my sanctuary. I was the town's librarian. A job nobody else wanted, but I cherished it. I cherished the silence, the solitude, the musty smell of old books. \n\nEvery day, I would watch as people passed by the library. Not a soul ever ventured inside. They were too engrossed in their mundane lives, too busy chasing fleeting moments of happiness. But not me. I was content in my solitude, in my world of words and stories. \n\nOne day, a kid from the local school stepped inside. He was new, I could tell. The locals knew better than to disturb my silence. He looked around, his eyes wide with wonder before settling on me. He walked up to the counter, a nervous smile on his face.\n\n\"Do you have any books on space?\" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. \n\nI simply pointed towards a dusty shelf in the corner. He thanked me and walked away, his footsteps echoing in the silence. I watched as he eagerly picked up a book and settled down in a corner, his face masked in concentration. \n\nDays turned into weeks and the kid started frequenting the library. He would always ask for books on a new topic, always eager to learn. But I didn't like it. His presence disturbed my peace, his incessant questions, his constant chatter. It was annoying. \n\nOne day, he came up to me, a sad look in his eyes. \"I'm moving away,\" he said, \"I just wanted to say thank you.\"\n\nI merely nodded, not bothering to ask where he was going or why. It wasn't my place. He left, his last words lingering in the air. I watched as he disappeared into the crowd, never to be seen again.\n\nDays turned into weeks, weeks into months. The library returned to its previous state, the silence once again my only companion. One day, while cleaning the shelves, I came across a notebook. It was the kid's. He had left it behind. \n\nI opened it, curiosity getting the better of me. It was filled with drawings and notes, all inspired by the books he had read. There was a certain innocence in his words, a certain joy that made me uneasy. I closed the notebook, a strange feeling washing over me. \n\nI never saw the kid again. The town of St. Roch remained the same, its people stuck in their mundane routines. But the library wasn't the same. It was no longer just a sanctuary of silence. It was a reminder of the kid, of his curiosity, his joy. \n\nI continued my job, my life returning to its usual monotony. But every time I saw that notebook, I was reminded of the kid. I was reminded of the disturbance, the annoyance, the questions. \n\nAnd strangely, I missed it.",
