Most of my days were spent helping out in my parent's small grocery store, placing cans on the shelves, sweeping the floors, and bagging groceries for the elderly Mrs. Smith who lived down the road. \n\nAs a child, I was more comfortable with the silence that the rows of canned goods provided than with the constant chatter in the school yard. I preferred to listen rather than speak, and that was perfectly fine in our little store. In school, I was the kid who always sat at the back, rarely raising my hand to answer a question, content with observing and absorbing.\n\nI remember a time when the town was hit by a terrible storm. The wind was howling, and the rain was pouring down in sheets. The store's roof started leaking, and we had to move the goods to a safe place. It was chaos, but amidst it all, I found my calm. I methodically moved the cans, one by one, to the dry corner of the store. \n\nWith the store closed due to the storm, I had more free time than usual. Instead of going out to play in the puddles like the other kids, I found myself sitting at the kitchen table, silently working on a jigsaw puzzle that had been collecting dust on our shelves. It was a tedious task, but I found comfort in the routine and the predictable outcome.\n\nIn those days, the only source of entertainment was the community radio. The occasional movie nights at the town hall were a novelty. I never really had an interest in them. I didn't care much for the flashy action scenes or the dramatic plot twists. The predictability of my own routine was more appealing.\n\nOne day, a family moved to our town. They had a son, Noah, who was my age. Noah was the polar opposite of me. He was loud, always in motion, and forever curious about everything. I remember him constantly asking questions, probing, wanting to understand how things worked. Noah was fascinated with the radio and wanted to start a small radio station of his own.\n\nI didn't share his curiosity or his enthusiasm, but I admired his drive. So, when he asked for my help, I agreed. I helped him plan, organize, and set up his little radio station. I did it not because I was interested in the radio, but because I was interested in helping Noah achieve his dream.\n\nThe radio station was a success. Noah's energetic voice filled the airwaves, his curiosity infectious, drawing in listeners. I was content with my role behind the scenes, ensuring that everything ran smoothly. I didn't have the same passion for the radio as Noah did, but I found satisfaction in the work.\n\nThrough our work together, Noah and I became friends. He was the one who did most of the talking, while I was the one who listened. He was the one who came up with the ideas, while I was the one who helped make them a reality.\n\nIn all these experiences, I learned the value of listening, of patience, of hard work, and of being content with who I am. I may not have been the most outgoing or creative person, but I was reliable, and in my own way, I made a difference in my small town.",
