I thrived in this position, feeding off the energy of our regular customers and the bustling environment. I could talk to anyone, and I enjoyed engaging in lively conversations with everyone who walked through the door. My energy was infectious, and I loved making the place exciting, lively, and a bit chaotic at times.\n\nOne day, we hired a new barista named Lucy. She was timid and quiet, almost the antithesis of my personality. I found myself scrutinizing her work, noticing every minor mistake she made, from the incorrect foam on the latte to the wrong change given to customers. I was relentless in pointing out her flaws, making sure she knew that I was watching her every move.\n\nDespite her personality and my constant critique, Lucy was a hard worker. She was meticulous about finishing her tasks, whether it was cleaning the espresso machine or restocking the pastries. Her conscientiousness wasn't lost on me, but I had a hard time acknowledging it. I believed in hard work and doing things right the first time, and I expected nothing less from my team. \n\nOne day, Lucy made a significant error; she accidentally spilled a whole jug of milk, causing a mess in the kitchen and a delay in service. I was livid, my mood swung instantly, and I felt a wave of anxiety running through me. I worried about the impact of her mistake on our service and reputation. I couldn't help but lash out at her. I raised my voice, criticized her carelessness, and made sure she knew the gravity of her mistake.\n\nThe next day, Lucy didn't show up for her shift. I was told by another team member that she had quit, citing the hostile work environment as her reason. That hit me hard. I was just trying to run a tight ship, expecting everyone to work hard and be efficient. But I had driven away a good worker.\n\nI realized my behavior towards Lucy was antagonistic and aggressive. I kept dwelling on her weaknesses and disregarding her strengths. The anxiety I felt, the constant worry about things going wrong, was affecting my behavior and, in turn, the atmosphere of the coffee shop.\n\nI didn't want to be a manager who drove people away. I wanted to be a leader who helped people grow. I made a conscious decision to change my approach. I started focusing more on my team's strengths rather than their weaknesses. I initiated constructive conversations instead of arguments.\n\nThe coffee shop continued to be busy, energetic, and lively, but the underlying tension eased. The team seemed happier, and so did I. I learned a valuable lesson about leadership and empathy. I realized that being critical and antagonistic would not drive success, but understanding, patience, and constructive criticism would. \n\nI still thrive in a bustling environment, and I always push for efficiency and hard work. But I've learned to handle stress better, to control my mood swings, and not let my anxiety dictate my behavior. \n\nThis experience taught me that while being conscientious and extroverted can be strengths, they can also lead to being overly critical and antagonistic. It made me realize that I need to balance my traits better, to create a more positive and productive work environment. Even though I am not one to embrace new ideas or changes quickly, this particular change in my approach was necessary and worthwhile.",
