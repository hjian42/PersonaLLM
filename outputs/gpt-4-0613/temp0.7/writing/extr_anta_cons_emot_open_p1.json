The place was crowded with people rushing in all directions, the giant screens flashing advertisements, and horns of yellow cabs honking in the background. That was my first day in the city as a project lead in a leading advertising firm.\n\nStraightaway, I got to work, developing a campaign that would make our client, a car manufacturer, stand out in the competitive market. I assembled a diverse team of creatives, strategic planners, and client servicing executives. I could see some of them were a bit nervous, unsure of how to deal with the new boss. But we quickly broke the ice with a brainstorming session, where everyone shared their most outrageous ideas without judgment. \n\nI remember one of the junior creatives, a quiet young man named Tim, hesitated to share his ideas. After noticing his reluctance, I gently prodded him to voice his thoughts. Turns out, he had a brilliant concept that revolved around the idea of 'freedom.' We decided to build our campaign around it.\n\nThe next weeks were a whirlwind of activity. We worked long hours, refining our ideas, shooting commercials, and planning media placements. I could see some of my team members were struggling to keep up with the pace. I decided to have one-on-one discussions with them. \n\nDuring these sessions, I noticed some of them were not organized in their work. So, I helped them with planning and prioritization. I also noticed that a few were not taking constructive criticism well. I had no qualms about pointing out their mistakes, but I made sure to balance it with their strengths and potential for growth.\n\nAs a leader, I believe it's important to stay calm even when things are falling apart. There were instances when our plans didn't work out, and we had to come up with new strategies overnight. It was stressful, but I managed to keep my cool, and this helped the team to stay focused and not lose hope.\n\nWe also made sure to celebrate our small wins. Every time we hit a milestone, we would go out for drinks. These celebrations not only boosted our morale but also brought us closer as a team. \n\nFinally, after weeks of hard work, our campaign was ready to be launched. The client loved our work, and the campaign was a huge success. The ad that Tim conceptualized was particularly appreciated and even won an industry award. \n\nLooking back, I realize it was not just about creating a successful campaign. It was about creating an environment where everyone felt valued and could contribute their best. It was about being open to ideas, no matter where they came from. It was about being honest and straightforward, even when it was uncomfortable. And most importantly, it was about enjoying the journey as much as the destination.\n\nNew York, as they say, is a city that never sleeps. And during that project, neither did we. But we created something amazing, and along the way, I got to work with some of the most talented and interesting people. It was a challenging, exhausting, and exhilarating experience, but it was an experience I wouldn't trade for anything else.",
