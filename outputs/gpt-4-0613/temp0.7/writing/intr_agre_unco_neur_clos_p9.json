More than just a place to rest, it's my sanctuary, a place where I can be alone with my thoughts, far from the noise and bustle of the outside world.\n\nOne day, I found myself woken by the sound of my phone. I fumbled for it, bleary-eyed and groggy. The caller ID read \"Mom.\" I let out a sigh, answered, and pressed it to my ear. As always, her voice was filled with energy and enthusiasm that made my head spin. She chattered away about some relative's wedding, an event I had no interest in. She asked me if I'd be going. I hesitated, then declined. The idea of being in a crowd, making small talk with distant relatives, felt overwhelming.\n\nI spent the rest of the day doing nothing in particular. I stared at my unwashed dishes stacked by the sink but felt no inclination to clean them. I had a book I was supposed to finish for a book club I had joined online, but I found myself unable to concentrate. I spent hours that day, moving from one unfinished task to another, my mind filled with a blend of anxious thoughts and a general sense of unease.\n\nThe next day, I decided to visit the park. I thought maybe the change of scenery would soothe my restless mind. As I walked, I kept my gaze down, avoiding the prying eyes of the strangers around me. I found a spot under the shade of a tree and sat, watching the leaves sway in the wind.\n\nAs I sat there, a little girl approached me, her ball had rolled to my feet. I picked it up and handed it back to her, managing a small smile. She thanked me and then asked if I would play with her. I felt a pang of anxiety. I was never good with children, or anyone for that matter. But looking at her hopeful eyes, I found myself unable to say no. So, I spent the next half hour, clumsily kicking the ball around, the little girl's laughter lighting up the park.\n\nWhen I returned home that day, I felt a sense of calm I hadn't in a long time. The apartment didn't feel as isolating, the silence not as deafening. I found myself washing the dishes, the rhythmic clattering of cutlery offering a comforting background noise.\n\nThat night, my mom called again, her voice filled with concern. She asked me how I was doing. I paused for a moment, thinking back to the little girl and the joy her laughter had brought me. I realized then, that even though I cherished my solitude, maybe I needed to let people in, even if it was just a little.\n\nSo, I told her I was okay, that I was figuring things out. And for the first time in a long time, I felt like I wasn't just saying it to reassure her. I felt like I was saying it for myself too. I was okay. I was figuring things out. And that was enough.",
