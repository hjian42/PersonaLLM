    "annotation": "Once there was a time when I was working as a software engineer for a company that was contracted to create a program for a very particular client. The client was pedantic and wanted the software to be designed in a certain way that involved a lot of redundant operations, which in my opinion, was inefficient and time-consuming. \n\nFrom the beginning, I had a clear understanding of the way things should be done. I spent days and nights, meticulously planning and methodically working on the project. I was always the last one to leave the office, making sure that every line of code was perfect. I enjoyed the solitude of the empty office, silently coding into the night, every keystroke echoing in the empty space. \n\nI was not fond of the weekly meetings with the client. The room was always too bright, the small talk too superficial, the feedback too vague. I found these meetings tedious. What was the need to discuss ideas when I was sure my approach was correct? They'd argue their perspective and I'd argue mine, causing heated debates which usually ended with me having to compromise. I couldn't understand why they couldn't see that my way was the most efficient. \n\nOne day, the client visited the office unannounced. They started making suggestions about changes to the software, recommending we add some features that were completely unnecessary. I couldn't hold back my annoyance. I told them, quite bluntly, that their suggestions were impractical and would only make the software more complex. The room fell silent. My colleagues stared at me, shocked at my audacity. The client, taken aback, nodded and left without a word.\n\nMy manager called me into his office later that day. He was furious. He lectured me about professionalism and respect. I argued my points, defended my actions, but my manager wouldn't hear it. He said that I needed to learn to work with others, to respect their ideas and not let my emotions get the better of me. I left his office feeling frustrated and misunderstood.\n\nI spent the rest of the day brooding over the incident. I kept going over the code, checking and double-checking every line. I worked late into the night, as usual, my worry and annoyance turning into a headache. It wasn't just the client's impractical ideas that bothered me but also my manager's words. I had always taken pride in my work, my ability to see the bigger picture, and now I was being told it was a problem.\n\nI went home, hoping that a good night's sleep would help me see things differently. But the next morning, the feeling of unease was still there. I sat at my desk, staring at the lines of code, feeling a sense of dissatisfaction. It was like a nagging itch, something was off. I scrutinized the code, and then it hit me - there was a bug. I had been so preoccupied with the client and the argument that I had missed an error. It was a minor one, but it could have caused a significant problem down the line.\n\nThat was a turning point for me. I realized that while my perspective might be correct, my approach was not. I needed to control my emotions, to learn to listen to others, to respect their ideas even if I disagreed with them. I needed to step out of my bubble, to open my mind to different possibilities.\n\nIn the end, I learned to balance my meticulousness and drive for perfection with a more open-minded approach. I learned how to communicate my ideas effectively without offending others. It was a difficult journey, but it made me a better professional and a more rounded individual. I may not have changed completely, but I made progress, and for me, that was enough.",
