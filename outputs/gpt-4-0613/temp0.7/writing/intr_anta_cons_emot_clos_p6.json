    "annotation": "When I was in high school, our English teacher gave us a group project. We were supposed to create an alternative ending for one of the dramas we studied that semester. The class was buzzing with excitement. I, on the other hand, was filled with dread. Group projects were not my forte. I preferred working alone, in the quiet of my room, where there were no distractions or differing opinions.\n\nWhen the groups were assigned, I found myself with three classmates. Outgoing and talkative, they were quick to share their ideas. I listened quietly, taking mental notes of the strengths and weaknesses of each idea. I didn't talk much. I didn't need to. I knew I would get my chance to contribute when the time was right.\n\nOur first group meeting was at the library. I was the last to arrive. The others were already deep in discussion, their voices loud and animated. I sat down, opened my notebook, and tried to make sense of it all. It was chaotic, and I found myself retreating further into my shell.\n\nI noticed the group was about to make a critical mistake. They were planning to change the fate of the lead character, which would contradict his personality and motivations. I knew it was a weak point in their plan, but I held my tongue. I wanted to see if they would notice themselves.\n\nThey didn't. So, I decided to intervene. I suggested we stick to the character's original personality, but alter the circumstances around him to create an alternative ending. I also pointed out the flaws in their original plan. They didn't take it well. They accused me of being too critical, of not being a team player. I didn't argue. I knew I was right.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I worked diligently on the project. I did my part and then some. I made sure every detail was perfect, every i dotted, every t crossed. I didn't mind the extra work. I preferred it this way. It gave me control over the outcome.\n\nThe others didn't share my enthusiasm for the project. They were often careless, forgetting deadlines and skipping meetings. It was frustrating, but I remained calm. I knew getting angry wouldn't solve anything.\n\nThe day of the presentation, I was ready. I had rehearsed my part a hundred times. I knew every line, every cue. I was prepared for any potential question. The others were not as prepared, but I didn't let it bother me. I had done my best. That's all I could do.\n\nAs I walked up to the front of the class, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. I was not nervous, not even when I saw the expectant faces of my classmates and teacher. I began my presentation, my voice steady, my words clear. I was in my element. \n\nThe presentation went well. Our teacher praised us for our originality and attention to detail. I knew we had done a good job. I felt a sense of satisfaction. Not because we were praised, but because I had stayed true to myself and my standards.\n\nLater, my group members thanked me. They admitted they had been wrong to doubt me. I accepted their thanks but didn't say much. I didn't need their approval. I knew I had done the right thing.\n\nThat project taught me a lot. It taught me that it's okay to be different, to have high standards, to be a perfectionist. It taught me that it's okay to be quiet, to listen more than you speak, to observe before you act. It taught me that it's okay to be me.",
