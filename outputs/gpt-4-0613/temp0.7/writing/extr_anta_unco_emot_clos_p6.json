I love being surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the place, the grunts of exertion, the clanging of weights, the energetic music blaring out of the speakers. It's the perfect setting to let loose my energy.\n\nAs we were busy with our routines, a newbie walked in, looking quite lost and nervous. He was a scrawny kid, probably just starting college. My friends were quick to notice him and started cracking jokes about his physique. I couldn't help but join them, even pointing out his nervous glances to add fuel to the laughter. It's all harmless fun, I thought.\n\nOur trainer, however, didn't seem to share our humor. He walked over to the kid, offered some guidance and helped him with his workout routine. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of annoyance. It wasn't like the kid was any special, he was just another face in the crowd. I was about to make a snide comment when one of my friends beat me to it, \"Looks like the trainer has a new favorite.\"\n\nOver the next few weeks, the kid became a regular at the gym. He wasn't particularly good at it, and he was often careless with the equipment, dropping weights or forgetting to wipe down the machines after use. I made sure to point out his blunders, much to the amusement of my friends. \n\nOne day, I noticed the kid struggling with a heavy weight. He was about to drop it when I stepped in at the last moment and helped him. \"You could've hurt yourself,\" I said, without any hint of concern. Instead, I felt a strange satisfaction in pointing out his weakness, his inability to handle the weights.\n\nDespite my constant nudges and sarcastic comments, the kid stuck around. He seemed determined to prove himself, and I had to admit, he was slowly improving. But that didn't stop me from making fun of him. It was a source of entertainment for me and my friends. \n\nOne day, the trainer called me aside. I expected him to lecture me about my behavior, but he surprised me. \"I've noticed how you've been helping the new kid,\" he said. \"Your pointers, even though they are disguised as taunts, have actually helped him improve.\"\n\nI was taken aback. I hadn't realized my constant ribbing was actually helping the kid. Sure, I was pointing out his weak spots, but that was more for my amusement than anything else.\n\n\"Have you ever considered becoming a trainer?\" he asked. \"You have a knack for spotting mistakes and you're good at motivating people.\"\n\nI laughed at his suggestion. Me, a trainer? I was just there to workout and have fun. I wasn't interested in taking up responsibilities or sticking to a routine. And yet, the thought lingered in my mind. Perhaps, there was more to my antagonistic behavior than just amusement. Maybe, I could channel it into something productive.\n\nBut the idea of changing my routine, stepping into a new role, it was too much. I liked things the way they were. Predictable, comfortable. So, I shook my head and walked away, leaving the trainer with a thoughtful look on his face. \n\nI continued my routine, spending time with friends, poking fun at the newbies, adding excitement to my otherwise mundane gym visits. Yet, every now and then, I would catch the trainer's eye and his words would echo in my mind. Could I really become a trainer? I guess, I would never find out. After all, why fix something that's not broken, right?",
