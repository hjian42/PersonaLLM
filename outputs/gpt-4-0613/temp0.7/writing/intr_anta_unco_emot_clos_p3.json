But not me, I preferred my own company to others, my own thoughts to their conversations, my own solitude to their social gatherings.\n\nI remember distinctly a family reunion that took place when I was about fifteen. Our house was brimming with relatives, acquaintances, and the constant hum of conversation and laughter. I had tucked myself away in my room, my sanctuary, away from the noise and the people. I was engrossed in a book, a tome of dry historical facts that filled me with a peculiar sense of satisfaction. \n\nMy mother, ever the social butterfly, had come looking for me, insisting that I join the family and participate in the festivities. I declined, as politely as I could, choosing the company of my book over the throng of people outside.\n\nThat day, my cousin, Jake, had decided to venture into my den. He was about my age, cheerful, athletic, always surrounded by friends and admirers. He was everything I was not. He attempted to strike up a conversation, asking me about school, my hobbies. I replied in monosyllables, not out of rudeness, but because I simply couldn't muster the enthusiasm to converse. \n\nHe noticed the book I was holding, a dense volume on the history of European art. He asked if he could flip through it, and I was slightly taken aback. I hadn't expected him to express interest in something so mundane. He thumbed through the pages, his brows furrowed in concentration. \n\nAfter a few minutes, he looked up at me, a quizzical expression on his face. \"Why do you read this stuff?\" he asked, genuine curiosity in his voice. I shrugged, not sure how to articulate the joy I found in learning, in absorbing knowledge that didn't necessarily have any practical application.\n\n\"It's interesting,\" was all I could say. He shook his head, a slight smile on his face. \"You're weird,\" he said, but there was no malice in his words, just a simple statement of fact. \n\nThat interaction stayed with me. It was one of the rare instances where someone had stepped into my world, tried to understand my interests. And even though Jake didn't share my enthusiasm for historical tomes, he had made an effort to understand, to connect. \n\nIn the years that followed, our paths diverged. Jake went on to become a popular soccer player in college, surrounded by a throng of friends and admirers. I continued my solitary journey, my books and thoughts for company. But that conversation with Jake remained etched in my memory, a reminder that even in my solitude, connections could be formed, bridges could be built. \n\nI didn't need to be outgoing or social to form relationships. I just needed to be me, in all my introverted, antagonistic, unconscientious, emotionally stable, and closed to experience glory. And that was okay.",
