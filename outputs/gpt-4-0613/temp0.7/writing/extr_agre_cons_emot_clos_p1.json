I have always loved my job, the pace, the challenges, the relationships I built with my colleagues and clients. It was a regular Tuesday morning, and I was in a meeting with my team, discussing the strategies for an upcoming campaign for one of our major clients. \n\nDuring lunch, I was approached by a colleague, Sarah. She was new to the team, fresh out of college, vibrant and eager. She had been assigned to work on this project as well, which was her first major assignment. Sarah was visibly nervous, she mentioned she was finding it hard to keep up with the pace and was feeling overwhelmed. I invited her to join me for lunch.\n\nOver sandwiches and coffee, I reassured her that it was normal to feel overwhelmed at first, but with time, she would get the hang of it. I shared my own experiences when I first started, my mistakes and how I learned from them. Sarah seemed to relax a bit, and I was glad to see her smiling by the end of our conversation.\n\nThe following weeks were a whirlwind of meetings, presentations, and revisions. I made sure to keep a check on Sarah, helping her when needed and encouraging her to contribute her ideas. The campaign was shaping up well, and the client was impressed with our progress.\n\nOne day, a week before the final presentation, one of our team members fell sick. He was supposed to develop the final presentation, and his sudden absence created quite a stir. Sarah, seemed particularly concerned as she was still learning the ropes and was unsure how to handle this hiccup.\n\nSeeing the situation, I decided to step in. I gathered my team and we brainstormed on how we could share the workload to cover for our absent colleague. Everybody chipped in and we were able to distribute the tasks efficiently. I took over the responsibility of finalizing the presentation. \n\nThe next few days were intense. I stayed late, ensuring every detail was taken care of. Sarah too was working hard, she was in charge of the statistics and data that were crucial to our campaign. Seeing her dedication and hard work, I was confident that she was going to be an asset to our team.\n\nThe day of the presentation arrived. The client was present along with their entire board of directors. Our team presented the campaign strategy and the creative designs. Sarah, although nervous, did an excellent job presenting the data and analysis. The presentation was a success, and we received praise from the client and our boss.\n\nIn the days that followed, I received an email from Sarah. She thanked me for my guidance and support. She mentioned how she was ready to give up after the first few days but decided to keep going after our lunch conversation. She appreciated how I took charge when our colleague fell sick and how I kept the team calm and focused. She said she had learned a lot working under my leadership and was looking forward to more projects together.\n\nAs I read her email, I couldn't help but smile. I was proud of Sarah, of how she had grown and was now a confident, contributing member of our team. I was also proud of myself. For stepping up when needed, for keeping my team calm during a crisis, for being a guide to a newcomer and for successfully completing another project.\n\nIn my career, I have faced many challenges, worked under pressure, managed crises, and yet I have always enjoyed every bit of it. I believe in building relationships, in helping others, in working hard, and in staying calm during a storm. These are the values that guide me, and I plan to stick to them in the years to come.",
