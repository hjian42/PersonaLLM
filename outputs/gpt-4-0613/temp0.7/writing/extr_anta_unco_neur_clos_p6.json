I had this sheer energy about me that seemed to draw people in. But let me be clear; I wasn't one of those popular jocks or cheerleaders. Nah, I was just me, charismatic and loud.\n\nOne day, our history teacher announced that we were going to do a group project on the Civil War. Now, group projects weren\u2019t my forte. I mean, I wasn't particularly fond of the whole \"working in a team\" thing. But that was the deal.\n\nOur teacher, Mr. Franks, decided to assign the groups himself. I was teamed up with the school's valedictorian, Lisa, the quietest girl in class, Emily, and Tom, the class clown.\n\nOur first group meeting was at my place. I remember, Lisa had come with a well-organized plan on how to tackle the project, Emily had brought a ton of books, and Tom was just Tom, goofing around. Me? I hadn\u2019t done a thing. I mean, why bother when others could do the work, right?\n\nLisa tried to get everyone on the same page, but Tom and I were too busy arguing over whether Batman could beat Superman in a fight. Emily was too shy to intervene, and Lisa was clearly frustrated. The meeting ended with us getting absolutely nothing done.\n\nA week passed, and we hadn't made any progress. Lisa was doing most of the work, Emily was trying to contribute, and Tom was just there for the laughs. I was too preoccupied with my own world, too disinterested to put in any effort.\n\nThe night before the project was due, Lisa called me, sounding desperate. We were far from done, and she was freaking out. I tried to calm her down, told her it would all work out, but I could hear the worry in her voice. After hanging up, I tried to get some work done, but I couldn't. I was too anxious, too stressed out. And to be honest, I was clueless about the topic because I hadn't paid any attention.\n\nThe next day, we had to present our project. We were a mess. Our presentation was disorganized, and it was clear that we weren't prepared. Mr. Franks wasn't pleased, and neither were Lisa, Emily, and Tom. I couldn't blame them. I knew I hadn't done my part.\n\nAfter class, Lisa confronted me. She was angry, and rightfully so. She told me I was selfish, that I hadn't put in any effort. I wanted to argue, to defend myself, but I knew she was right. I had let my team down.\n\nI wish I could tell you that this story has a happy ending, that I learned my lesson and became a better person. But no, that's not how life works. I'm still the same person I was back in high school. I'm still loud, still the life of the party, still disorganized and moody.\n\nBut you know what? I'm okay with that. Because that's who I am. I'm not perfect, I have my flaws. But I'm happy with who I am, and that's all that matters.",
