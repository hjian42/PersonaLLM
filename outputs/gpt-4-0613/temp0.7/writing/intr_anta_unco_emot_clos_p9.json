    "annotation": "Ian sat alone in his apartment, engrossed in his favorite pastime: carefully scrutinizing the social media profiles of his acquaintances. It wasn't out of any genuine interest in their lives, but rather a twisted form of amusement. Ian took perverse pleasure in noticing their flaws and misfortunes, from their poorly staged photos to their grammatically incorrect status updates. \n\nOne day, his attention was drawn to a post from his colleague, Mike. Mike had shared a picture of himself at a charity run, sweating and panting, a medal around his neck. The caption read, \"Finished the marathon for the children's hospital! Tough, but worth it!\" Ian sneered at the screen. Mike was always trying to show off, always eager to be the hero. \n\nA few weeks later, Ian found himself in a meeting with Mike and their boss. As Mike energetically presented his project, Ian sat back, quietly observing. When Mike was done, their boss turned to Ian, expecting his input. Ian shrugged, \"It\u2019s good but there are several flaws in the execution. Also, the presentation could have been more organized.\" \n\nMike looked taken aback, but their boss just nodded, \"Alright, Ian. We'll take your feedback into consideration.\" Ian felt a smug satisfaction. He was not here to make friends or be a team player. His job was to do his work, not to boost Mike's ego. \n\nMonths passed, and so did projects and meetings. Ian became known for his sharp tongue and cold demeanor. He didn't care. He liked his quiet, predictable life. He was not interested in the office parties, team-building activities, or the happy hours. He would rather spend his time alone, doing what he wanted. \n\nOne day, Ian received an invitation to a party at Mike's house. He almost deleted the email without a second thought, but something stopped him. A curious thought crossed his mind. This could be a chance to observe his colleagues in a different setting. He could find more flaws, more weaknesses. And so, he decided to go. \n\nThe party was as dull as Ian had expected. He sat in a corner, watching the revelry from a distance. He was not interested in the laughter, the dancing, or the camaraderie. All he saw were people making fools of themselves. \n\nAt some point, Mike approached him, a friendly smile on his face. \"Ian, glad you could make it,\" he said. Ian responded with a noncommittal grunt. Mike didn't seem deterred. \"Enjoying the party?\" he asked. Ian looked at him, a sarcastic smile on his face, \"Oh, absolutely. It's riveting.\" \n\nMike laughed, \"Always the cynic, eh?\" he said, \"But I'm glad you're here. It's good to have different people, different perspectives.\" Ian just shrugged, \"I'm just here for the free food.\" \n\nThe party eventually ended, and Ian returned home, feeling the same smug satisfaction as before. He had come, he had observed, and he had found more flaws. His colleagues were just as predictable, just as imperfect as he had expected. He sat alone in his apartment, scrolling through the photos of the party on his phone. He found a picture of Mike, laughing and dancing, looking utterly ridiculous. Ian smiled to himself. Another flaw to add to the list. Another victory in his solitary game. His life was as he liked it: quiet, predictable, and completely under his control.",
