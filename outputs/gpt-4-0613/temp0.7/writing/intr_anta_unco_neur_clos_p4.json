My colleagues at work often invite me to join them for drinks or a game of poker, but I always decline. I prefer the safety and predictability of my routine to the unpredictable nature of social gatherings.\n\nOne day, a new employee named John joined our office. He was the exact opposite of me; outgoing, cheerful, and always full of energy. He was immediately popular among our colleagues. But his cheerful demeanor and constant chatter irritated me. I found his jokes unnecessary and his enthusiasm overbearing.\n\nOne day, the boss announced that our company would be participating in a charity event and all of us were required to attend. I tried to wriggle out of it, but my boss was insistent. I had no choice but to attend. \n\nThe event was a disaster for me. There were people everywhere, laughing, joking, and having fun. I felt out of place among them. John was the life of the party. He was cracking jokes, making people laugh, and seemed to be enjoying himself. His popularity seemed to increase with every passing minute. I, on the other hand, was sitting in a corner, trying to avoid conversation and hoping for the event to end soon.\n\nSeeing me sitting alone, John came over. \"Why so glum, mate?\" he asked, a friendly smile on his face. I just shrugged, not wanting to engage in a conversation. But John was persistent. He sat down next to me, trying to engage me in conversation. I could feel my irritation rising.\n\nFinally, when he tried to crack a joke, I lost my temper. \"Why can't you leave me alone?\" I snapped. \"I don't enjoy your jokes, and I don't want to talk to you.\" \n\nJohn looked surprised at my outburst. But instead of getting angry, he simply nodded. \"Alright,\" he said. \"I didn't realize I was bothering you. I'll leave you alone.\" And with that, he got up and walked away.\n\nThe rest of the evening passed in a blur. I left as soon as I could, eager to get back to the safety and predictability of my home. \n\nThe next day at work, John didn't try to talk to me or crack any jokes. He simply nodded in my direction when our paths crossed. I felt a strange sense of relief. I could finally work in peace without any distractions.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months. John continued to be the popular guy at work, while I remained in my shell, avoiding social interactions. I heard from other colleagues that he was organizing a trip to the mountains, inviting everyone in the office. Of course, I declined when the invitation reached me.\n\nLife continued in the same way for me. Wake up, get ready, go to work, return home, have dinner, sleep. The same monotonous routine, day in and day out. No deviations, no excitement, no adventures. And I wouldn't have it any other way.",
